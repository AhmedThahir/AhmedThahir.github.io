# Environment
## Night Driving
- Much harder at night, than day
- Eye adaptation: Close eyes for a few seconds before starting to drive to speed up eyes to adjust to low light
- Avoid interior lights, dim dashboard lights
- Use low beam whenever, and use high beam only when required as it may dazzle other drivers

## Fog
- Use low beam headlights and fog lights; high beam will reflect
- Use defrost for front glass
- Don't overtake

## Sandstorm

## Slippery and Sandy Roads

## Rain
- Initial rain drops is more dangerous, since they loosen the grease and dirt
- Poor visibility
- Poor tyre traction
- Aquaplaning/Hydroplaning
	- Buildup of Layer of water between wheels and road
	- At low speeds, good tyre designs can dissipate water buildup; this is hard at high speeds
- Large braking distance
	- Double the safe distance
## Times of the day
- Sunrise/Sunset: Glares can cause issues
- Peak traffic hours

## Natural Forces
