# Risk Stratification

Separating a patient population into high-risk and low-risk of having an outcome

- Predicting something in the future
- Goal is different from diagnosis, with distinct performance metrics
- Fuzzy classification
- Diverse data

Risk stratification drives interventions that target high-risk patients

Goal is to reduce cost and improve patient outcomes

## Applications

- Pre-mature infant’s risk of severe morbidity
- Does this patient need to be admitted to coronary-care unit
- Likelihood of hospital readmission

| Limitations | Manual<br />Sample-specific<br />Not used as much as required due to high friction |                                                              |

## Framing for Supervised ML

Why are gaps important? To avoid label leakage

Sparsity-encourage models

- Easier to interpret
- Helps deploy model to different clinics where they may not have access to all the data

## How to get labels

- Manual
  - Label patients’ data by “chart review”
    - Visualization of individual patient data time series
- Automatic
  - Rule-based
    - Labels may get revised regularly based on standards
    - For eg
      - 2020: 200 units of sugar = diabetes
      - 2025: 100 units of sugar = diabetes
  - Machine learning to predict if the patient is “currently” diabetic

Based on

- medications: may not have record of
  - purchase
  - intake
- lab data

## Intervention-Tainted Outcomes

Form of Self-Selection Bias

Let

- Group A: Patients with Pneumonia **with** history of asthma
- Group B: Patients with Pneumonia **without** history of asthma

Observation: Group A dies less often than group B

### Discussion

![image-20240528150537120](./assets/image-20240528150537120.png)

1. Reason group A dies less is due to more intensive care
2. Long survival time may be due to treatment

### Conclusion

1. Does this mean group A has lower risk? No
2. Should we treat group A with less priority? No

### Hacks

1. Remove such features from the model; not feasible for high-dimensional data
2. Redefine outcome by finding a pre-treatment surrogate (such as lactate levels)
3. Consider treated patients as right-censored by treatment

### Solutions

1. Interpretable models are very important
2. Causality modelling: Reframe question to “Will admission to ICU lower likelihood of death for patient”

## Deep Learning for Risk Stratification

Not very big gains

![image-20240528151532044](./assets/image-20240528151532044.png)

Baseline is L1-regularized Logistic Regression, with good structural features

Sequential data in medicine is very different from language modelling

- Many time scales
- Significant missing data
- Multi-variate observations
- Not enough data to learn subtle non-linear interactions
