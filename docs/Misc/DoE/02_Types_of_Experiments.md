## Differences-in-Differences

Let

- Control: $y_0$ be the time series with $x=0$
- Treated: $y_1$ be the time series with $x=1$
- $D_t$ be the difference of the 2 series

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{0t}
&= f(t) + \beta_1 (T=0) \\
&= f(t) \\
y_{1t} &= f(t) + \beta_1 (T=1) \\
D_t &= (y_1 - y_0)_t
\end{aligned}
$$

### Assumptions

- Parallel trends: $f_1(t) = f_0(t)$
	- confirmed by evaluating regions without the treatment
- No differential timing: Check Goodman-Bacon decomposition
- Absence treatment: no other variables
- Difference between the treatment & the control group is time-invariant
	- any difference in their difference must be due to the treatment effect.

### Why not other way?
- Wrong ways: Impossible to know if change happened because of treatment or naturally
	- Only comparing treatment group before/after
	- Only comparing treatment/control group at a particular time

## RDD

### Threats

#### Manipulation

People may change behavior when they know of the cutoff

Discontinuity exists in the running variable even without any treatment

![](assets/rdd_manipulation.png)
![](assets/rdd_manipulation_nba.png)

Check with McCrary Density Plot

![](assets/McCrary_Density_Test.png)



#### Non-Compliance

People on the margin of the cutoff may/may not get treatment, by misrepresenting the running variable
- Some people may not want treatment even though they crossed the cutoff
- Others may request access to the above discarded treatment spots

This is different from manipulation, where the actual running variable comes out different

For eg: Misreporting income
