# Introduction

## Experiment

Deliberate variation of one/more process variables while observing effect on one/more response variables

## Experimental Design

- Maximize information gain
- Minimize resources (time and cost)

DOE is a procedure to plan experiments to efficiently provide valid conclusions

Does the experiment have enough statistical power to answer research questions?

## Types of input variables

|                           | Dealing                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Controlled                | Variation + repeats/replication experiments in a systematic way |
| Uncontrolled & observed   | - Blocking: group experiments into blocks, each having a fixed value of the variable<br />- Analysis of covariance: Model impact of variable, and then subtract it out |
| Uncontrolled & unobserved | Randomization: Impact of variable averages out to 0          |

Nuisance inputs: Inputs that we donâ€™t care about, but affect the output
