# Introduction

## Why is energy special?

- There should be equilibrium between power generation and consumption
- Transportation and distribution performed on power network, with specific physical rules
- Storage is uneconomical
- Large part of energy demand is of critical nature (hospitals, residencies)
- Consumers should not differentiate origin, quality and nature of production

## Deregulation

## Economic impact of renewable energy

Wind and solar energy induces a downward pressure on market prices

## Quest for Flexibility

Flexibility is seen as ability to adapt to variable and unforeseen changes in operating conditions

- Generation units
- Power system
- Demand side
- Integrated energy systems view (heat and gas energy systems)

## IDK

| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Producers         | Fossil fuels | Wind<br />Solar    |
| Fixed Production  | ✅            | ❌                  |
| Fixed Demand      | ❌            | ❌                  |
