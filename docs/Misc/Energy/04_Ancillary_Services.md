| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Primary   | Shared among all system operators<br />Daily day-ahead auctions<br />Inflexible demand<br />Needs upward & downward capacity<br />Energy not considered (energy-neutral service ) |
| Secondary | Relieve primary reserve which has ben activated<br />Restore any imbalance on interconnections<br />Capacity purchases on monthly basis<br />Combines symmetric upward & downward products<br />Based on bilateral contracts (negotiated; non-public)<br /><br />Negative revenue in downward regulation case consists in buying back energy that is already sold through day-ahead market |
| Tertiary  | Daily day-ahead auctions<br />Varying demand<br />Need upward & downward capacity<br />Energy paid for at balancing price |
