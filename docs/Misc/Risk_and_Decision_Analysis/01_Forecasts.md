# Forecasts

Forecasts are never perfect.

Forecasting projects is like steering a car using the rear view mirror.

## Flaw of Averages

Fundamental problem in design and evaluation of projects on the ‘average’/‘most-likely’ future forecasts

Due to misunderstanding of probability and systems behavior

### Jensen’s Law

$$
E[ \ f(x) \ ] \ne f( \ E[x] \ ), \\
\text{if } f(x) \text{ is convex curve}
$$

where

- $E[ \ f(x) \ ]$: Average of possible outcomes of $f(x)$
- $f( \ E[x] \ )$: outcome calculated using average of $x$
- Convex function example: $x^2 + c$

The equality holds true when $f(x)$ is linear, but in reality, most systems are non-linear
