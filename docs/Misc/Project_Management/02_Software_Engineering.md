## Project Management Models

|                 |                                                              | Advantage                             | Disadvantages                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Waterfall       | - Concept: Setting the goal<br/>- Design: Acquire the requirements, such as programmers<br/>- Pre-Production: Verify if the concept and design are feasible<br/>- Production<br/>- Testing<br/>  - Alpha<br/>  - Beta<br/>- Shipping<br/>- Maintenance |                                       | Most of the actual feedback will occur at beta testing, which is too far ahead in the timeline, and hence it will be too late to respond. |
| Classical Agile | - Individuals and interactions > processes and tools<br/>- Working software > comprehensive documentation<br/>- Customer collaboration > contract negotiation<br/>- Responding rather > over following a plan | Focus on features that consumers want | Assumes interchangeable tasks & team members<br />Depends on good communication |
| Scrum           | 1. Transparency<br />- Everyone on the team related to a decision is involved<br />- Shared responsibility<br />2. Inspection: Anyone on the team curious on why something is the way it is, can<br />3. Adaptability |                                       |                                                              |

#### Time-boxing

Every thing should be assigned a particular max-duration

If time gets over, go ahead with the best solution possible rather than wasting more time trying to obtain the “perfect” solution

#### Clear goal & agendas

If you don’t know why exactly you are having a meeting, you shouldn’t be having it

#### Involved participants

If someone does not need to be there, don’t force them to attend

### People

| Person        |                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Product Owner | Has complete understanding of the product<br />Guides the team |
| Scrum Master  | Administrative<br />Runs the meetings<br />Facilitator<br />Mediator |
| Team Member   |                                                              |

Ideally Product Owner and Scrum master should always be different, as each of their roles is very tiring as is.

## Feature Size

- Discuss as an entire team whenever possible
- Each role should try to lend its perspective
- Listen & try to make sense of what others are saying
- Offer alternate solutions & point out problems
- Divide huge features into atomic features
- Everyone related to the decision should be there
