Behavioral Assumptions
- Investment is exogenous of fiscal policy
- Consumption is endogenous to disposable income

### Consumption

Assuming Consumption $\propto$ Income

$$
C = c_0 + c_1 (I-T)
$$

- $C =$ total consumption
- $c_0 =$ base/autonomous consumption
    - $c \ne 0$
- $c_1 =$ MPC (Marginal Propensity to Consume)
- $I =$ Income
- $T=$ Taxes
- $(I-T)=$ disposable income

### Output Multiplier

$m = \dfrac{1}{1-c_1}$ 

Implication
- If $m>1$: even small consumer spending will lead to increased output
- If $m \le 1$: lots of consumer spending required for growth

## Paradox of Saving

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Investment} &= \bar S^G + S(Y) \\
S(Y) &= \dfrac{1}{1-c_1} Y & (\text{Output $Y$ = Income})
\end{aligned}
$$

If savings $S(Y)$ increase due to decrease in $c_1$
- then savings > investment, ie consumption decreases 
- then $Y$ reduces to restore equilibrium
- this reduces income
- this reduces consumption
- this reduces output
- vicious cycle

where $Y =$ Real output

This is why drastic contractionary fiscal policy is detrimental
- introducing high GST/VAT
- decrease in govt expenditure
