# Core Principles

## Markets are usually good



## Government


## Standard of living

Standard of living of a country depends on its production level

Productivity: amount of goods and services produced by a worker during an hour of work
- As efficiency increases, time to produce goods/services decreases, standard of living increases

Disparities in standard of living is caused due to difference in productivity
- i don’t exactly agree with this cuz women have a history of earning less for the same productivity


## Prices rise when govt prints excess money

If you print money without them producing anything, money loses its value and inflation occurs
However, if you print money due to increase in the country's output, then it's fine

When prices of commodity increases, value of money reduces

value of money $\propto \frac{1}{\text{price of commodities} }$

#### Micro Effects

Money-givers gain

Fixed income money-receivers lose
eg: regular employees

Variable income money-receivers not affected
business people, freelancers

#### Macro Effects

Imports increase: demand for domestic products decreases, as they are costlier
Exports decrease: as other countries do not want a more expensive product

Hence, high inflation is not good


### Welfare Cost

The cost associated with any action that has macro-level consequences and affects entire society
eg: taxes, interest rates have welfare costs associated with them

## Economy faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment

Short run: period where contracts cannot be renegotiated (monthly, quarterly)
Lon run: a long period (annually) which contains multiple renegotiations of contracts

### Phillips Curve Relation

- y-axis = inflation
- x-axis = unemployment

$$
\text{Inflation} \propto \frac{1}{\text{Unemployment}}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi_t &= \alpha - \beta U_t &  (\pi_t = - \beta U_t + \alpha, \ y = mx+c) \\
\text{Taking derivative wrt } \pi_t \implies \beta &= - \frac{d \pi_t}{dt}
\end{aligned}
$$

- $\pi_t =$ Inflation
- $\alpha =$ inflation when there is no unemploment
- $\beta =$ cost for reducing unemployment by a unit
- $U_t =$ actual rate of unemployment

This relation is only short-run
for long run, whatever is the inflation, unemployment tends to natural unemployment
the graph will be a straigth line parallel to the y-axis

During shortrun, the contracts for raw materials, employees is fixed
but prices for commodity increases
therefore, producers increase production to maximize profit (misperception by producers); this is done by increasing employees
Unemployment rate decreases

Moreover, workers suffer money illusion (only focus on the nominal income increase;  don’t realise that the real income is the same)

Then in the long run, few months later, the employees will renegotiate for higher wages; then the producers will hesitate as they no longer see the attraction for producing at such large volume and paying such wages; so they fire employees; therefore, the unemployment rate will increase again
