# Macroeconomic Measures

In macro, production = income

## Aggregate Output

Why is it in currency?
- To make everything into a single unit of measurement

## Inflation

Sustained rise in the general level of price

Inflation rate: Rate at which prices of commodities increase

$$
\pi_t = \dfrac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}
$$

|         | +ve Inflation                     | Deflation (-ve inflation)          |
| ------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Meaning | increase in prices of commodities | decrease in prices of commodities  |
| Comment | Happens when economy is growing   | More dangerous than high inflation |

Usually targeted inflation
- developed countries: 2-3%
- developing countries: 5-8%

Why is small inflation good? Incentivizes spending

### Inflation Models

#### Taylor Rule

Inflation rate something

$$
I_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 (\pi_t - \pi_t^*) + e_t
$$

#### Money Supply

$$
I_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 M_t + e_t
$$

|                      | Optimal Inflation Rate |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Developed Countries  | 2%                     |
| Developing Countries | 4-6%                   |

## Inflation, Unemployment, Output

$$
\text{Output} \propto \text{Inflation} \propto \dfrac{1}{\text{Unmployment}}
