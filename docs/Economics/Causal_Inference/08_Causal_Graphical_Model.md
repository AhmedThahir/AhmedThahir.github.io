# Causal Model

A causal/scientific model $M$ for a set of RVs $\{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ is a model of the joint distribution $p(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ as well as the causal structure governing $\{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ which describes the causal relationships among the variables and how the data-generating process occurs
$$
M: y \leftarrow x
$$

## Causal Graph Model

Causal diagram/graph is a graph that can be used to represent a causal structure and hence, describe our quantitative knowledge about a causal mechanism

Causal model that uses a causal graph to represent the causal structure is called as Causal Graph Model/Causal Bayesian/Belief network.

- Causal diagrams can make assumptions scientific and "falsifiable"
- Causal diagrams can help identify which variables to randomize, include in model, or ignore

RCM was developed in statistics, causal graphical model is derived from CS/AI.

## Parts of Causal Model

1. Causal Structure $G$: Direction of causality (What causes what)
2. Statistical Model $H$: Joint distribution function

$$
M = (H, G)
$$

### Example

Consider a model $y = 2x$. This is a statistical model.

If $y \leftarrow 2x$, then it means that $x$ causes $y$. This is a causal model.

Let’s analyze the $x,y$ pairs for the following sequential changes.

| Model       | 1. do$(x=2)$ | 2. do$(x=3)$ | 3. do$(y=2)$ |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Statistical | 2, 4         | 3, 6         | ==1, 2==     |
| Causal      | 2, 4         | 3, 6         | ==3, 2==     |

This is because, $x$ causes $y$; not the other way around.

## `do`-calculus

Let
- $G$ be a DAG
- $G_{\bar T}$ represent $G$ post-intervention (ie with all links into treatment $T$ removed)
- $G_{\underline T}$ represent $G$ with all links out of treatment $T$ removed

Rules
1. $P(y \vert \text{do}(t), z, w) = P(y \vert \text{do}(t), z) \iff Y \perp\!\!\!\perp W \vert (Z, T)$ in $G_{\bar T}$
2. $P(y \vert \text{do}(t), z) = P(y \vert t, z) \iff Y \perp\!\!\!\perp T \vert Z$ in $G_\underline{T}$
3. $P(y \vert \text{do}(t), z) = P(y \vert z) \iff Y \perp\!\!\!\perp T \vert Z$ in $G_{\bar T}$ and $Z$ is not a descendent of $T$

## Causal Diagram/Graph

Directed graph that represents the causal structure of a model. It is represented using a bayesian network: DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in which each node has associated conditional probability of the node given in its parents. 

The joint distribution is obtained by taking the product of the conditional probabilities.

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(x_1, \dots, x_n)
&= \Pi_{i=1}^n \ p( \ x_i \vert \text{pa}(x_i) \ ) \\
x_i \ & {\tiny \coprod} \ \text{nd}(x_i) \vert \text{pa}(x_i)
\end{aligned}
$$
where

- pa = parent
- nd = not descendant

Useful when you are only interested in the causal structure, and not so much in the statistical model

```mermaid
flowchart TD
B([B]) & C([z]) --> A([A])
```

$$
P(A, B, C) =
P(A | B, C) \cdot P(B) \cdot P(C)
$$

### Why DAG?

- Directed, because we want causal effects directions
- Acyclic, because a variable cannot cause itself.

my question is: What about recursive loops, such as our body’s feedback loops

| Directed Edges - Causal directions | 1. The presence of an arrow from $x_i$ to $x_j$ indicates either that $x_i$ has a direct causal effect on $x_j$ – an effect not mediated through any other vars on the graph, or that we are unwilling to assume such a effect does not exist<br/>2. The absence of an arrow from $x_i$ to $x_j$ indicates the absence of a direct effect; the absence of an arrow hence represents a more substantive assumption |

### Properties

Causal diagrams compatible with a joint distribution $p(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ must satisfy

| Property                | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Causal Markov Condition | Every var is independent of any other vars (except its own effects) conditional on its direct causes                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Completeness            | All common causes (even if measured) of any pair of vars on the graph are on the graph<br />This property is as important as the requirement that all relevant factors are accounted for. Our ability to extract causal information from data is predicated on this untestable assumption |
| Faithfulness            | The joint distribution $p(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ has all the conditional independence relations implied by the causal diagram, and only those conditional independence relations                                                                                                               |

- $\text{nd}:$ non-descendent
- $\text{pa}:$ parents

## Validating Graphical Model

Consider 2 variables $v_1$ and $v_2$
- If $v_1$ is connected to $v_2$, there should be a correlation
- If $v_1$ is not connected to $v_2$, there should be no correlation between $v_1$ and $v_2$ given $\text{pa}(v_1)$, ie for each group of $\text{pa}(v_1)$

### Confounding

#### Self Selection Bias

Special case of confounding, when $z$ affects the selection of $x$ and also has a causal effect on $y$, then $z$ is confounder.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
c([Ability/Talent])
a([Education])
b([Earnings])

c -->|Affects<br/>selection| a
c -->|Directly<br/>Affects| b

a -->|Associated but<br/>not necessarily causes| b
```

Here, education may **not necessarily** causally affect earnings.

#### Unmeasured Confounding

We need to find new ways to identify causal effect

| $z$ fully observed | $\not \exists$ unmeasured confounding | Selection on  |

| ✅                  | ✅                                     | observables   |
| ❌                  | ❌                                     | unobservables |

However, in some cases, there can exist a set of observed vars conditioned such that it satisfies the back-door
criterion, by blocking all non-causal paths
b/w $x$ and $y$

```mermaid
flowchart TB

subgraph Conditioned
	direction TB
  wc([w]) -.- zc & yc
  zc[z] --- xc([x]) --> yc([y])
end

subgraph Unconditioned
	direction TB
  wu([w]) -.-> zu & yu
  zu([z]) --> xu([x]) --> yu([y])
end

linkStyle 3,7 stroke:green
linkStyle 0,1,2 stroke:none

classDef dotted stroke-dasharray:5
class wu,wc dotted
```

$w$ is a confounder to $x$ and $y$, but we do not need to observe it, as causal effect of $x$ on $y$ is identifiable by conditioning on $z$

### Effect Modifiers

Confounders $s$ that change the causal effect of a treatment $x$, since their causal effect on the outcome $y$ interacts with treatment’s causal effect on $y$

Controlling them help control conditionally randomized experiments.

Consider the following causal diagram.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

subgraph After Simplification
	others([s<sup>y</sup>]) & x2([X]) --> y2([Y])
end

subgraph Before Simplification
	a([A]) & b([B]) & c([C]) & w([W]) & x1([X]) --> y([Y])
end
```

where $s^y$ is anything other than $x$ that can causally affect $y$; ie, the set of potential effect modifiers

An example could be gender, temperature, etc.

Mathematically, $s$ is an effect modifier if
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(y) &\ne P(y \vert s) \\
E[y \vert \text{do}(x)] &\ne E(y \vert \text{do}(x), s)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Instrumental Variable

Independent var that affects $y$ indirectly via $T$ only

```mermaid
flowchart TB

subgraph Scenario B
direction TB
T2 --> y2
v((v)) --> I2((I)) & T2
u2((u)) --> T2((T)) & y2((y))
end

subgraph Scenario A
direction TB
I((I)) --> T --> y
u((u)) --> T((T)) & y((y))
end

classDef green fill:green
class I2,I green
```

A variable $I$ can serve as an instrumental variable for identifying the causal effect of $T$ on $y$ $\iff$
1. Relevance: $I$ is associated with treatment $T$
	1. $r(I, T) \ne 0$
	2. Testable with stats
2. Exclusion: $I$ indirectly affects $y$ only through $x$
	1. $I$ affects $y$: $r(y, I) \ne 0$
	2. $I$ does not affect $y$ directly: $r(y, I \vert T) = 0$
		1. Every open path connecting $I$ and $y$ has an arrow pointing into $x$
		2. $I$ is d-separated and independent from any common causes of $x$ and $y$, since $x$ is a collider on their paths
	3. Testable with stats and theory
	4. Hardest condition to satisfy and prove
3. Exogeneity: $I$ is not associated with omitted variables $u$
	1. $r(I, u) = 0$
	2. Testable with theory

Rule of thumb: more surprising an IV is, the more likely it is a good one

#### Education

Parent’s education is IV for child wage through child education

```mermaid
flowchart TB
pe(["Parents<br/>Education<br/>(IV)"]) --> ce(["Child<br/>Education<br/>(x)"]) --> ci(["Child<br/>Income<br/>(y)"])

pe -.- ag(["Child<br/>Age, Gender<br/>(s)"]) --> ce & ci
city(["City<br/>(FE)"]) --> pe & ce & a & ci

a(["Ability<br/>(s)"]) -..-> ce & ci

classDef dotted stroke-dasharray:5
class a dotted

classDef highlight fill:darkred,color:white
class pe highlight

linkStyle 1 stroke:green
```

College-educated parents have +ve impact on children’s college attainment, either through better home education or because they are more capable of affording college education.

If we assume that more educated parents

- don’t produce children with higher unobserved abilities/preferences that affect education and wages
- don’t directly help children obtain higher wage jobs

The statement holds true as the only way parent’s education affects individual’s earnings is through effect on child’s education.

#### Demand Elasticity

```mermaid
flowchart LR

op[Oil Price]
cs[Climate @ Production]
cd[Climate @ Consumption]

subgraph Supply
direction LR
ps[Supply Price]
qs[Supply Quantity]
end

subgraph Demand
direction LR
pd[Demand Price]
qd[Demand Quantity]
end

pset["Selling Price (x)"]
qeq["Sales Quantity<br/>ie, Equilibrium Quantity<br/>(y)"]

op & cs --> Supply --> pset --> qeq
cd --> Demand --> qeq
```
- IV through supply: Oil Price and Climate at production site
- IV through demand: Climate at consumption site

#### Promotion

Randomized promotion/encourage of usage of a policy is an instrument, as it matches all 3 criteria

Will only give the CACE

### Fixed Effects

Variable that captures effect of unobserved confounders

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat y
&= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \textcolor{hotpink}{\tau} + u \\
\implies
\widehat{\text{ATE}}
&= \beta_1
\end{aligned}
$$

#### City is a Fixed Effect

City captures ability, school quality, productivity and other unobserved factors

## IDK

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(x_a, \dots, x_b)
&= \Pi_i \  P(x_i \vert \text{pa}(x_i))
&& i = [a, b]
\\
p(x_a, \dots, x_b \vert \text{do}(x_c=1)) 
&= \Pi_i \  P(x_i \vert \text{pa}(x_i))
&& i = [a, b], i \ne c
\end{aligned}
$$
## Intervention

$\text{do}(x_i = a)$ implies removing all arrows entering $x_i$ while setting $x_i = a$, hence removing the effect of all parents of $x_i$

Hence $x_i$ becomes endogenous after intervention

```mermaid
flowchart TB

subgraph Post-Intervention
direction TB
a2((a)) & b2((b)) --- c2((c)) --> d2((d))
end

subgraph Pre-Intervention
direction TB
a1((a)) & b1((b)) --> c1((c)) --> d1((d))
end

| Post-Intervention | $p( \ A, B, C, D \vert \text{do}(C=c) \ ) = p(D \vert C=c) \cdot P(A) \cdot p(B)$ |


$$
p(A \vert \text{do}(C)) = p(A) \\
p(A \vert C) \ne p(A)
$$


## Adjusting/Conditioning

To ensure that $E(y|x=1) = E(y^1)$, we need to ensure that the population and treated-sample are the similar in their features.

2 ways of eliminating the unwanted effect of confounders/effect modifier $z$
- Adjusting - Remove the effect of $z$ on other variables
- Conditioning - Hold variable $z$ constant

## Adjusting

- Eliminates self-selection effect from confounders
- Way to adjust for backdoors
- Reduces model dependence

This allows for removal of unnecessary data

## Conditioning

Rule of thumb
- Condition common causes
- Do **not** condition common effects

If we condition on a set of vars $z$ that block
all open non-causal paths between treatment $x$ and outcome $y$, then

- the causal effect of $x$ on $y$ is identified (estimated from observed data)
- $z$ is said to satisfy the ‘back-door criterion’
- Conditioning on z makes $x$ exogenous to $y$

### Covariate Balance

In a sample where is $z$ is a conditioned confounder
$$
P(z \vert x = x_i) = P(z \vert x = x_j) \quad \forall i, j
$$

If $x$ is binary
$$
\begin{aligned}
& x \in \{ 0, 1 \} \\
\implies & P(z \vert x=1) = P(z \vert x=0)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Matching

Converting non-RCT observed sample into a sample that satisfies Covariate Balance, ie behaves similar to a RCT sample through control of observed confounding.

## Limitations of Causal Graph

### Effect Modifiers

There is no way for causal graph to represent the causal effect of input $x$ on output $y$ due to some effect modifier. For example

```mermaid
flowchart TD
f(("Fertilizer<br/> (x)")) & t(("Temperature<br/> (s<sup>y</sup>)")) --> y(("Yield<br/> (y)"))
```

Temperature does not affect how much usage of fertilizer, but we know that the temperature affects the **effectiveness** of the fertilizer, but we have no way of representing that here. However, the [Causal Effect Formula](09_Causal_Effect_Learning.md#Causal Effect Formula) will take care of that.

### Cycles
Does not support cycles

Workaround
```mermaid
flowchart TB

subgraph After
direction TB
1[a_t-1] --> 2[b_t] --> 3[a_t]
end

subgraph Before
direction TB
a --> b --> a
end
```
