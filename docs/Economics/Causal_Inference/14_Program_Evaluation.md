| Output                 | Tangible goods & services produced by activities<br>You have control over these | ✅            | ✅          |                         |
| Outcome<br>(Effects)   | What happens when the target population uses the outputs<br>                    | ❌            | ❌          |                         |

## Program Theory

- How and why an intervention causes change
- Theory for the sequence of events that connects inputs to activities to outputs to outcomes

## Types of Program Evaluation


|                                               | What                                                                                                                            | When   | How                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Formative Evaluation/<br>Needs Evaluation     | Is the program needed?<br>What inputs & activities does it need?<br>What outcomes does it need to cause?                        | Before | Interviews<br>Surveys                     |
| Economic evaluation/<br>Cost-Benefit Analysis | Is the program worth it?<br>Do the benefits of helping the target population outweigh the costs of running the program?         | Before | Net Present Value                         |
| Process evaluation/<br>Program monitoring     | Are inputs going to the right places?<br>Are activities working correctly?<br>Are activities producing right levels of outputs? | During | KPI Dashboards                            |
| Outcome Evaluation                            | Are activities and outputs leading to initial outcomes<br>(short-term impact evaluation)                                        | During | Causal inference<br>Surveys<br>Interviews |
| Impact Evaluation                             | Does the program cause lasting change in the outcome                                                                            | After  | Causal inference                          |

## Types of Impact Evaluation

| Types                                                                                                           | Validity | Requires structural model | Example                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Evaluating the impacts of historical programs on outcomes in the same population/environment                    | Internal | ⚠️                        | Policy in same country    |
| Forecasting the impacts of programs implemented in one population/environment in other populations/environments | External | ✅                         | Policy in another country |
| Forecasting the impacts of programs never historically experienced.                                             | External | ✅                         | Effect of tax             |

For all three types of problems, if we want to evaluate welfare impact, we need a structural model.

## Ethics

- In order to evaluate programs, control groups are essential
	- Dilemma: People who could benefit from the program would not be assigned to it
	- "Groups should not be excluded from an intervention that is known to be beneficial, solely for the purpose of evaluation" ~ World Bank Impact Evaluation in Practice
- Follow IRB (Institutional Review Board) guidelines
	- Respect for people: Make sure participants give informed consent
	- Beneficence: Don't lie
		- Minimize potential harm
		- Maximize potential benefit
	- Justice: Benefits & burdens of research are equitably-shared by different groups
- Maintain privacy: Any published data should be de-identified
