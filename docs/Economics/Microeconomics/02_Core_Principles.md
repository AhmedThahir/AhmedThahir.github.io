# Core Principles

## There's always Trade-offs

When choosing an option, you're always giving up on something else; ie there is always an opportunity cost

It is due to scarcity of resources; every resource is finite; nothing comes free

Eg: when i want to study, i'm giving up sleep

## Real Cost

Cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it

Real Cost = relative price = opportunity cost

$$
\text{OC} = \frac{\text{What you sacrifice}}{\text{What you receive}}
$$

Fraction that shows what is to be sacrificed to pick an option A instead of B.

This can be incorporated into daily life instead of regular pros/cons list, by adding a cost/benefit associated with every factor for a decision.

It's not just monetary cost

## Rational people think at Margin

Rationality: making a decision considering all possibilities to obtain best outcome with minimal input and losses.

Marginality: making decisions considering **incremental** benefits/costs associated with an action; not at total benefit/cost

marginal profit (net benefit) = marginal benefit - marginal cost
Proceed incrementing production as long as marginal net benefit $\ge$ 0

## People respond to incentives

Incentive: instrument to induce an individual to act/react
tool to change behavior

Subsidies = +ve incentive
Taxes = -ve incentive

## Trade

Voluntary transaction between parties, resulting in their betterment.

Trade offs are there as everything has pros/cons, gains/costs; other options could have been chosen, but did not as the customer takes the best option

### Trade benefits everyone

1. Reduces cost of production through specialization
   Specialists require lower resources for production, because they are really good at it; hence they can increase output
2. Both parties gain a greater variety of goods and services

Overall trade gains depends on

1. choice set
2. cost minimization

Individual gains depends on

1. Terms of trade
   basically means the exchange rate
2. Bargaining power
   1. nature of the product (Shelf life / perishability)
      The one with the greater shelf life product will have greater bargaining power because they don't have to sell in a hurry
   2. elasticity of demand

### Benefits of scale

You get larger benefits with lower costs if you focus on specialization at large scale

Larger systems are more productive per unit input

The average cost reduces when the volume of production increases

eg: college mess cooking
$$
\text{Cost}(y) = y^\alpha
$$
Where $y =$ output quantity

Benefits of scale exists if $\alpha < 1$
