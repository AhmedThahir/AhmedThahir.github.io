# Welfare Economics

Measure of well-being

Normative (subjective) analysis

## Purpose

### Problem

- Unknown utility function
- Unknown satisfaction

### Solution

- Compensating variation
	- How much would one be willing to pay to increase their satisfaction
	- How much would one be willing to pay not to be worse off

## Surplus
