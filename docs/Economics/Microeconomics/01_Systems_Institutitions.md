Firms: Organizations that use land, labor and capital to produce goods and services to generate profit

### Functions of Market

1. Organizing economic activity
2. Determining the optimal price
	- supply reflects the availability/abundance of the commodity
	- demand reflects the willingness for purchasing commodity
	- ==price for a product without a market(demand/supply) for it is undefined==
3. Encourage efficiency and specialization
4. Signaling of availability
	- Seasonality: Seasonal food
5. Allocation of resources

| Price | Reaction of Production | Reaction of Demand |
| :---- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Inc   | Inc                    | Dec                |
| Dec   | Dec                    | Inc                |

   Not all market signals are pure market signals
   Distortion of market signal: when govt creates policies to change pricing in a free market
   Eg: subsidies

### Market Power

It is the power of firms to control their selling price. It allows them to determine their own profits. It depends on

- type and intensity of competition
- costs of production
    - this influences the type of competition in market, because it is cheaper for one firm to produce at a larger scale
    - big companies threaten small by lowering their price, to make them run out of business; otherwise acquire their company
    - eg: Facebook-Instagram

Sometimes, consumer may have greater market power. This occurs when there is only a sole consumer, but many sellers
eg: Dubai Metro

## Market Failure

- Reasons why market is not functioning the way it is 'supposed' to be
- Prices do not capture the effects of individual actions
	- Public goods
	- Externalities
	- Monopolies
	- Missing markets
	- Asymmetric information

Market fails when it comes to non-excludable commodity

Example
- Fraud
- Imperfect information

### Monopoly

- private monopoly: unfair situation for consumers where there is only a sole producer of a product
- natural monopoly: situation where there is a single producer (like govt), but not necessarily bad; eg: Railways

- monopoly can be addressed through govt subsidies for the monopoly
- the monopoly company will tend to increase output to attain the new maximum marginal net benefit
- hence, the level of optimal output will be greater after subsidies than without it, and hence the producers increase the supply
- this will reduce the price and benefit the consumers

### Duopoly

A situation with multiple buyers, but only 2 sellers

Nash equilibrium (by John Nash) says that

> An agent who has a competitor will always design the best policy, with the assumption that the competitor will also design its own best policy

## Institutions

Rules for the system

Coordination: Invisible hand: Everyone working in their own self-interest drives the collective market

### Democracy

3 key characteristics
1. Rule of law
2. Civil liberties
3. Inclusive, free, and decisive elections

### Government

Govt is the only actor allowed to use legitimate force

Govt responsibilities
1. Protect property, civil & human rights of citizens
2. Maximize surplus/efficiency
3. Generate efficient outcomes, such as prevent 
    1. Monopoly
    2. Tragedy of Commons for CPR
        For community resources(like fishing ponds, forests), the govt comes in to prevent over-utilization of the resources; supports sustainability
3. Market failure: Govt interferes in fields where private investors are not interested
4. Promote equality/equity
    1. prevention of trade of whatever is socially harmful (alcohol, drugs)
    2. keeps market's obsession with efficiency at the expensive of equity in check
    3. reduces economic inequality
5. Socially desirable outcomes

Dangers
- Use of force to silence opponents: companies
- Rent-seeking
- Oligarchy
- Self-Enrichment

Well-designed governments have limits on government power
- Elections
- Constitution

#### Government Failure

- Failure of political accountability
	- Economic infeasibility: Public policy may not be effective if it does not provide efficient incentives (Nash equilibrium)
	- Administrative infeasibility: Public policy may not be effective if there is not sufficient state capacity or limited information
	- Political infeasibility: Public policy may not be effective due to vote (incentives, intransitivity, Condorcet paradox), short-termism, unequal access, lobbyists

### How to increase public participation

- Prevent large groups from free-riding by changing individual gains
	- Coercion: Increase cost of not acting
	- Selective incentives: Increase the benefits of acting
	- Federation: Make big group feel small

### Ideal Institutional Mix for Capitalism

Democracy is not the requirement

- [ ] Incentives for innovation
	- [ ] Secure private property
	- [ ] Competitive markets
- [ ] Efficient firms:
	- [ ] Competent leadership
	- [ ] Create goods at low cost
- [ ] Public policy
	- [ ] Govt policies that foster these conditions
- [ ] Public good provision
	- [ ] Govt fills gaps missed by private sector
