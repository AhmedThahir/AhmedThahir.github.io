## Assumptions of Classical Economics

1. stable & well-defined preferences
2. rational behavior
3. maximize utility function (happiness, etc)
4. only have self-interest
   1. People don’t care about others’ interests
   2. No peer-pressure

5. risk-averse
6. Perfect Bayesian information processors
   1. process information optimally
   2. pay perfect attention to all details
   3. don’t forget information

7. No biases
8. preferences over final outcomes, not changes
9. no “taste” for beliefs/information; purely objective

These may seem like we are making very incorrect assumptions. But these assumptions are required to understand the main concepts. For more accurate modelling, we use [Behavioral Economics](./../Behavioral_Economics)

## Trade

Voluntary transaction between parties, resulting in their betterment.

Trade offs are there as everything has pros/cons, gains/costs; other options could have been chosen, but did not as the customer takes the best option

## Factors of Trade

### Consumer

1. Preferences/Tastes
2. Cost (what is the amount expected of the customer)
3. Budget/Income (what is available to the customer)
4. Threshold/Willingness to make the trade

### Manager

1. Price of factors
2. Cost of production
3. Revenue/profits

## Handling Recession

| Incentivize       | Through                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Investments       | Lowering interest rate<br/>Providing subsidies               |
| Consumer spending | Universal Basic Income/Direct income transfers to people (only effective till a limit - excessive causes inflation)<br/>Reducing taxes |


## Methodology in Economomic Analysis

|                 | Positive analysis                                            | Normative Analysis       |
| :-------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
|      Topic      | **What** is the problem?                                          | **How** the world should be  |
|     Nature      | Objective                                                    | Subjective               |
| Characteristics | Analytic & Descriptive                                     | Prescripitive            |
|      Extra      | Why the problem came up<br />no emotions/explanations if good or bad | what actions to be taken |
|    Examples     | Increasing taxes will lower consumer spending<br />Increasing interest rate will lower demand for loans<br />Raising minimum wage will increase unemployment | Taxes must be increased  |

## Budget Deficit

Scenario where Govt Expenditure > Revenue. This happens a lot in developing countries, as they are trying to develop as rapidly as possible.

## Opportunity Cost

$$
\text{OC} = \frac{\text{What you sacrifice}}{\text{What you receive}}
$$

Fraction that shows what is to be sacrificed to pick an option A instead of B.

This can be incorporated into daily life instead of regular pros/cons list, by adding a cost/benefit associated with every factor for a decision.
