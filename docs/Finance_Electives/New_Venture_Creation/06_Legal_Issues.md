## Patent

### Requirements to get a patent

- Novel
  - Something new: Prior art must be cited
- Useful
- Patentable subject matter
- Not previously sold/publicly described
  - Enabling disclosure
  - 1 year window in US only
- Not obvious “to one of ordinary skill in the art”
  - Prior art “teaches against”
  - Commercial success can show non-obviousness

### Obtaining Patent

- Determine what to patent
- Determine when to patent
- Prepare one/more applications
- Prosecuting applications

### When to file

- Before you lose rights
  - Before a public disclosure
  - Before an “on-sale” bar
- First to file wins under AIA

### Parts

- Field of invention
- Background of invention
  - “Prior Art”
  - List of advantages compared to prior art
- Summary of invention
- Detailed description
  - Examples of use
  - Best mode: what is the best way to implement your invention
- Claims
  - What exactly is your invention

If you ever want to enforce the patent, claims is the part that matters. Hence this is where you should spend money for someone else to do, not the other parts.
