# Financial Projections

Failure to plan is planning to fail

## Startup CEO Role

Even if you don't understand accounting/finance, you need to know

- Average Selling Price
- Gross margins
- Cost of R&D
- Sales & Marketing Strategy & Expenses
- Start-up and/or Capital Expenses

## Venture Capitalist Wants

- 3-5x absolute returns
- 5-7yr investment horizon
- 4x in 5yrs = 32% IRR
- Get a significant amount of $ invested
- Own a significant ownership % (50% +)

$$
\text{VC} \% = \dfrac{\$ \text{Invested}}{\$ \text{Invested} + \text{Pre-VC Valuation}}
$$

## Tech Model

- COGS (Cost of Goods/Services): Unit costs + manufacturing O/H + Support
- R&D should be 10-20%
- G&A (General and administrative expensive) should be 5-15%
- Target operating profit of 15-20%
- Distribution strategy

- Build sales projection from the bottom-up

## Tech companies rules-of-thumb

- Staffing drives departmental expenses

  - Remainder will be rent, utilities, travel

## Cashflow Projections

- Burn rate
  - Monthly operating loss + capital expenditures
- Cash flow projection
  - Cumulative operating losses excluding depreciation
  - Plus cumulative capital expenses
- Determining total cash required
  - Cumulative operating loss + Cumulative capital expenses loss
  - On the month you turn cash positive
