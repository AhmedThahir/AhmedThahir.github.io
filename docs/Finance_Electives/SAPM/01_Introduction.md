## Security

Always invest in business, not stocks

Stocks don’t always ‘win’ in the long-run. Index funds are better, as they keep revising the portfolio. Easier to invest in index funds for passive income rather than evaluating yourself.

Yield on bond market actually is more volatile than stock market, due to fluctuations in the interest rate

## Taxes

### Dividends

Fully-taxable regardless of the dividend amount

Exception: if you are below the taxable income slab

### Capital Gains

|                                    | Tax in India | Taxable when          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| STCG<br />Short-Term Capital Gains | 15%          | Any gain              |
| LTCG<br />Long-Term Capital Gains  | 10%          | Only if gain > 1 lakh |
