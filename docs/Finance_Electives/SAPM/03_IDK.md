## Trading Styles

### Margin Trading

Allows investors to leverage
positions

A margin account provides you the resources to buy
more quantities of a stock than you can afford at any
point of time. For this purpose, the broker would
lend the money to buy shares and keep them as
collateral.

You need to maintain

- Initial margin
- Maintenance margin

Margin calls occur when an investor's equity falls below a certain
threshold, and the broker requires the investor to deposit more
funds into their account.

### Short Selling

Trader borrows shares from a broker and immediately sells them with the expectation that the share price will fall shortly after. If it does, the trader can buy the shares back at the lower price, return them to the broker, and keep the difference, minus any loan interest, as profit

Being short in an asset means investing in such a way that the investor will profit if the value of the asset falls. This is the opposite of a more conventional "long" position, where the investor will profit if the value of the asset rises

Security Lending and Borrowing Scheme â€“ 1997 (SLB):

  settlement of securities sold short.
