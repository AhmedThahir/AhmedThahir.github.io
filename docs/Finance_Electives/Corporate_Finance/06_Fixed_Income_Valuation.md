| -------------- | :-----------------------: | :---------------: |
| PAR            | Market Value = Face Value | YTM = Coupon rate |
| Premium        | Market Value > Face Value | YTM < Coupon rate |
| Discount       | Market Value < Face Value | YTM > Coupon rate |

#### Bond Price

$$
\text{Bond Price} = \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{\text{Coupon } t}{(1+\text{YTM})^t} + \frac{\text{PAR}}{(1+\text{YTM})^T}
$$

$$
\text{Bond Price } \propto \frac{1}{\text{Interest Rate}}
$$

This is because, if interest rate increases, lenders will go to loan market, and everyone will sell their bonds.
