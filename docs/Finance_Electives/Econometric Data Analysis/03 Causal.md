# Scope

Scope is the set of populations in which a causal effect applies. A causal effect is only meaningful if we can define its scope.

# Transportability of Results

The ability of the result can be extrapolated correctly from one population to another.

A causal effect learnt from a study is transportable from study population to target population if both are within the scope.

# Causal Mechanism Learning

To understand the true meaning and scope of a causal effect, we need to understand the underlying causal mechanism, based on **prior knowledge** - information and analyses.

This is important to understand

- causal effect - what it means, where it applies
- transportability of results

We have to understand the true mechanism and reason why a treatment affects the outcome. A randomized experiment is not a suitable reason to skip that step.

If the mechanisms in play are globally-applicable, then we can conclude that results of the study can be applied everywhere. Otherwise, we can**not** confidently conclude that.
