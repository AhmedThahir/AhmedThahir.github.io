# Proactive Design

## Stages of Analysis

| Stage                            |                                                              | NPV     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Base case                        | Consider base case design, for fixed objective (mission, specifications) |         |
| Recognize reality of uncertainty | - This may lead to different results due to system non-linearities<br/>- Capacity constraints systematically limit profit from good opportunities, while we suffer fully from risks<br />- Error of forecasts<br />- Distribution of possible outcomes of reality (volatility and uncertainty) | Lowest  |
| Incorporate flexibility          | - Adjust project actual needs, based on how future develops, and intelligently develop system over time<br/>- Run a Monte Carlo simulation of all possibilities, and then identify what is the best initial case, and what flexibility is optimal | Highest |
| Multi-dimensional valuation      | Not just expected NPV, but also other summary statistics of the possible NPVs from the simulations |         |
| Conclusion                       | Donâ€™t accept consequences of  distribution of uncertainties<br />- Avoid/reduce downside effects<br />- Take advantage of opportunities<br />- Reduce initial costs |         |

## Example: Mall Parking

Requirement: Major garage serving mega-mall

Actual demand uncertain, due to

- Population growth, demographics
- Mall success probability
- Competition

Engineering design assumes a fixed forecast!

### Optimizing base case

Find highest value design, by looking at each major design alternative. No

### Recognizing uncertainty

Costs may be easy to estimate, as contracts will give fixed bids.

However, demand is highly uncertain, especially as we proceed to the future

### Introducing flexibility into design

### Multi-Dimensional Valuation

### Conclusion

Build the mall in a way that we start out only 4 floors, but make the foundation and etc in a way that we can expand to the initial number of floors as required, even though this is more expensive than just building foundation capable for 4 floors.
