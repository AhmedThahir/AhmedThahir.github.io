Seasonal Demand for Outerwear: Winter is a peak time for outerwear sales, as customers actively seek warm, functional clothing<br>2. Online Shopping Trends: Consumers increasingly prefer shopping online, especially during winter months when weather conditions may discourage in-store visits.<br>3. Sustainability Appeal: Many customers value eco-friendly and sustainable outerwear options, making this a key selling point that remains relevant.<br>    <br>**Boxes to Doubted**<br>1. Traditional Retail Dominance: The assumption that brick-and-mortar stores are the primary sales channel may need to be reconsidered due to the rise of e-commerce.<br>2. Heavy Reliance on Discounts: While discounts drive sales, relying solely on price cuts may erode brand value and profitability in the long term.<br>3. Uniform Style Preferences: Assuming all customers prefer classic or traditional outerwear styles might overlook emerging trends like bold colors, unique designs, or tech-integrated apparel. |
