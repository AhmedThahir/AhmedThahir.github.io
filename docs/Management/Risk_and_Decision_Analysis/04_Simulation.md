# Simulation

Replicate outcomes of uncertain process

Works with any distribution

- Regular/irregular
- Continuous/not
- Normal/not

## Requirements

Distributions for key parameters

May be observed, estimated, assumed, or guessed

## Steps

1. Create a valuation model

2. Identify most significant uncertainties
   1. Tornado diagram

3. Choose distributions for uncertainties

4. Model distribution of outcomes

5. Set up decision rules for exercising flexibility, to ensure that it is right decision to exercise flexibility

   For eg: “Expand if observed demand > Capacity over 2 years. But don’t expand towards the end of life”

## Flexibility Types

|         | Flexibility “in” system                                    | Flexibility “on” system            |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
|         | Feature design to enable system to evolve easily           | Nothing to do with design          |
| Example | Building foundation to support additional floors in future | Abandon project<br />Delay project |
