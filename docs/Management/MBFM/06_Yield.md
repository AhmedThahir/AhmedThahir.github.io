# Yield Curve

Curve that shows the interest rate at different time horizons of holding a fixed-income security

## Purpose

- Indicator of future yield levels, and help in setting the yield for all debt market instruments
- Measure and compare returns across maturity spectrum
- One more point

## Types

|                                 | Causes                                                       |

| Flat                            |                                                              |

| Downward Sloping/<br />Inverted | Present Future interest rate < Present Short-term interest rate<br />Present Future interest rate < Future Short-term interest rate |

- Spot rate is the instantaneous rate
- Forward rate is the contract on a future rate
- Future rate is the spot rate in the future

## Theories behind Yield Curves

### Expectations Theory

Risk Neutrality

Consequence: Shape of yield curve will depend on the expected returns

| Theory              | Assumption                                                   |                                                              | Advantages | Limitation                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Expectations        | <br />Investors are risk-neutral                             |                                                              |            | Incorrect to assume that bonds with different maturities do not have different expected return <br />Bond-investors are risk-averse, not risk-neutral |
| Liquidity-Premium   | Investors are risk-averse<br />Bonds are partial substitutes for each | Investors demand risk premium for<br />- Maturity Risk Premium Premium<br />- Liquidity Premium |            | Does not explain downward sloping/inverted curves            |
| Market Segmentation |                                                              |                                                              |            |                                                              |

Maturity Risk Premium: With maturity, risk increases

Liquidity premium:
