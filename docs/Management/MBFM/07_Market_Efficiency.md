# Efficient Market Hypothesis

- Market corrects itself when new info becomes
  available, through quick analysis and
  necessary price adjustments
- Prices fully reflect all
  available information

## Market Efficiency

Represents only information-processing efficiency

No mis-pricings

- Good for investors
- Bad for speculators (Only mispricings will provide large gains. Just value investing provides nominal returns)

## Forms of Efficiency

According to Fama, markets are neither purely inefficient nor purely efficient

## Causes of Efficiency

- Sufficiently-large no of knowledgeable investors, who diffuse info
- Intense competition among investors
- Rapid transmission of information
- High speed of transactions
- Low cost of transactions

## Causes of Inefficiency

Probability of mispricings in asset market $\propto$

- $\dfrac{1}{\text{Ease of trading}}$
-  cost of information and transactions for exploiting inefficiency

## Anomalies

That prove that no market is purely efficient
