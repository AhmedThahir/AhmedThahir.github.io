- [ ] Reading brief
- [ ] If time gets over, go ahead with the best solution possible rather than wasting more time trying to obtain the “perfect” solution

## Brainstorming

1. No criticism
   - Negative feedback on ideas must be withheld until after the session
   - Positive feedback is okay
2. Free-wheeling
   - Wilder the idea, the better
   - Easier to limit an idea than think up
3. Quantity: More the ideas, more likely to have useful ideas
4. Build on ideas: Feel free to combine multiple ideas
