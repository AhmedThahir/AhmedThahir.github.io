# Localization

 Navigation is one of the most challenging competencies required of a mobile robot.

## Building blocks of navigation

1. Perception: Robot must interpret its sensors to extract meaningful data
2. Localization: Robot must determine its position in its environment
3. Cognition: Robot must decide how to act to achieve its goals
4. Motion Control: Robot must modulate its motor outputs to achieve the desired trajectory

Devices relying on localization include IMU, encoders, LiDARs, Ultrasonic sensors, onboard cameras

Methodologies include Markov, Monte Carlo, Kalman Filters
