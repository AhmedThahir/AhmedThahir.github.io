# Mapping & SLAM

## Mapping

Computer vision and cartography

Goal for an autonomous robot is to be able to construct (and/or use) a map/floor plan and to localize itself and its recharging bases.

## SLAM

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

Method for autonomous vehicles that enables building a map and localization of vehicle in that map at the same time.

Allow vehicle to map out unknown environments

## Need for Map

- Path planning
- Limiting error in state estimates, by providing opportunity to ‘reset’

## 2D Graph SLAM

Considering uncertainty in $x$ and $y$, gaussian functions are applied to maximize probability of product
$$
\mu = \Omega^{-1} \epsilon
$$
where

- $\mu =$ locations of landmarks and robot positions
- $\Omega=$  matrix of $X$ and landmarks
- $\epsilon=$ vector of constraints

## Constraints

- Initial constraint
- Relative motion constraint
- Relative measurement constraint
