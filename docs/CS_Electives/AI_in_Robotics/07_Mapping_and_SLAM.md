## Mapping

Computer vision and cartography

Goal for an autonomous robot is to be able to construct (and/or use) a map/floor plan and to localize itself and its recharging bases.

## SLAM

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

Method for autonomous vehicles that enables building a map and localization of vehicle in that map at the same time.

Allow vehicle to map out unknown environments
