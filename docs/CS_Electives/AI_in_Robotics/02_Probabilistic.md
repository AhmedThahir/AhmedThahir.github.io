# Probabilistic Modelling

- Every robot action is uncertain
- Every sensor measurement is uncertain

Probabilistic approach acknowledges these uncertainties and uses models to abstract useful information from data

Goal is an incrementally-updated probabilistic estimate of position of robot relative to map
