# Odometer

Use of data from motion sensors to estimate change in position over time. It is used in robotics by some legged/wheeled robots to estimate their position wrt starting location.

Types

- Wheel odometry
- Laser/Ultrasonic odometry
- GPS
- INS (Interval navigation system)
- Visual Odometry (VO)

Encoders are fundamental robotics motion control as they provide accurate and precise feedback about angle, position, and speed.
