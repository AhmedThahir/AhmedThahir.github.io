# Introduction

Data science is turning raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge to drive data-driven decisions and solve problems
- Collecting data
- Analyzing data
	- Statistics
	- Machine learning
	- Deep learning
- Communicating analysis

We cannot move away from domain knowledge and solely depend on algorithms

## Stages

1. Theory
2. ⁠Simulation
3. ⁠Empirical

Order should not be changed, as otherwise we can make up the story as we wish

## IDK

Always use GUIs for exploration
- ease
- ⁠rapid iteration
Use code to finalize
- reproducibility
- ⁠automation

## Decision-Making

Iterative process with feedback loops; not linear

| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data        | Collection of numbers with known context and uncertainty estimates               |
| Information | Right data at right time in right context, organized for access                  |
| Knowledge   | Interpretation of information based on model (understanding) of cause and effect |
| Decision    | Acting on knowledge for benefit                                                  |

### Process

- Preparation: Plan to turn data into information, with a specific model and decision in mind
- Testing/Experimenting/Measurement
- Analysis, with uncertainty: Use model to turn information to knowledge
- Decision
  - Using uncertainty
  - Risk/benefit analysis
- Post-mortem: Learnings to improve things

## Notes

- All models are wrong, some are useful
- Applying data mining algorithms on data that you don’t understand may result in false conclusions
- Always keep track of performed tests & analyses, to factor in data snooping

Use ML models to discover structural models, and then let the structural models to make the predictions, not the ML models

- Why: Black swans can be predicted by theory, even if they cannot be predicted by ML
- How: Use a non-parametric ML to identify important variables and then develop a parametric structural form model.

The complexity increases as we go down the above list, but the value obtained increases as well

## Data Mining

Generate Decision Support Systems

> Non-trivial extraction of implicit, previously-unknown and potentially useful information from data

> Automatic/Semi-automatic means of discovering meaningful patterns from large quantities of data

## Predictive Tasks

Predict value of target/independent variable using values of independent variables

- Regression - Continuous
- Classification - Discrete

## Descriptive Tasks

Goal is to find

- Patterns
- Associations/Relationships

### Association Analysis

Find hidden assocations and patterns, using association rules

#### Applications

- Gene Discovery
- Market Baset Data Analysis
  Find items that are bought together

### Clustering/Cluster Analysis

Grouping similar customers

#### Metrics

- Similarity
- Dissimilarity/Distance Metrics

#### Applications

- Grouping similar documents

- Clustering documents

  1. Vocabulary - All terms(key words) from all docs

  2. Generate document-term frequency matrix

     | Document \vert  Term | T1   | T2   | …    | Tn   |
     | ---------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
     | D1               |      |      |      |      |
     | D2               |      |      |      |      |
     | …                |      |      |      |      |
     | Dm               |      |      |      |      |


### Deviation/Outlier/Anomaly Detection

Outlier is a data point that does not follow the norms.

Don’t mistake outlier for noise.

#### Application

- Credit Card Fraud Detection
    - Collect user profile such as Name, Age, Location
    - Collect user behavior data

- Network Intrusion Detection
- Identify anomalous behavior from surveillance camera videos

## Misconceptions

- All forecasts will be inaccurate, so no point
- If we had the latest forecasting technology, all problems would be solved

## IDK

Ensure you are looking at the correct scale

Model $y_t/y_0$ instead of $y_t$ to standardize all time series

## Common problems with analysis

- Poorly-defined goals
- Data doesn’t meet needs of analysis objectives
- Analysis makes unwarranted assumptions
- Model is wong
- Data doesn’t support conclusion

Learning Process

1. Model building: Functional form
2. Identify parameter weights
3. Distribution of random errors

Each of them can have different levels of generalizability

For eg: Ohm’s Law

1. $V=IR$ remains constant for all materials (under certain conditions)
2. $R$ Changes for different materials
3. Errors are dependent on measurement and experimental methods, and are independent of materials

## Communication of Results

Storytelling is important

### Pitfalls

- Manipulation
	- Don't lie
	- Emphasize the story, but make the full data available
- Misrepresentation
	- Control expectations
	- Exaggerate your work, but do not over-exaggerate
- Ethos
	- Ethos $\ne$ Credentials
	- Credentials do not make an expert
	- Credentials do not *not* make an expert
- Equity
	- Don't dumb down: Just translate in a simpler way
	- Amplify underrepresented voices
