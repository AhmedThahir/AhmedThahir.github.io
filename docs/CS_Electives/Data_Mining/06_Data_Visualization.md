# Data Visualization

Display of data in a graphical/tabular format

Helps us understand the data; humans are better at recognizing visual patterns than numeric patterns

Limitation: Pareidolia; seeing patterns that do not exist

## Why is visualization important?

Widely different distributions can have the same statistical properties

| Example Case       | Visualization                                                    |                                              |

## Characteristics of Great Visualization

- [ ] Story
- [ ] Truthful: not aimed to mislead viewers, accurate representation
- [ ] Perception: Easy to understand
- [ ] Functional: useful and enlightening
- [ ] Insightful: reveals something that wouldn't have been possible otherwise
- [ ] Aesthetics: Grammar of Graphics
- [ ] Beautiful

## Grammar of Graphics

- [ ] Theme
	- [ ] Grid
	- [ ] Background
	- [ ] Typography
- [ ] Labels
	- [ ] Title
	- [ ] Subtitle
	- [ ] Caption: Extra text, source of data, etc
	- [ ] Axis Labels
	- [ ] Legend
		- [ ] Title
		- [ ] Items: try your best to align with the actual elements
- [ ] Coordinates
	- [ ] System
		- [ ] Cartesian
		- [ ] Polar
	- [ ] Range
		- [ ] Do not skew the axis: Use the correct minimum & max range
		- [ ] Exceptions
			- [ ] only possible values are included
				- [ ] For eg: for human body temperature, you should show 98-105 F; you shouldn’t start at 0
			- [ ] small movements matter
				- [ ] GDP across time
			- [ ] important time range
		- [ ] Tip: When presenting, show the full view, then zoom in clarifying the reason
- [ ] Facets: Subplots
- [ ] Scales: Axis
	- [ ] Discrete
	- [ ] Continuous
	- [ ] Continuous, breaks
	- [ ] Continuous, Log
	- [ ] Almost never use dual y-axes
		- [ ] Will lead to appearance of spurious correlations
		- [ ] Exception: When the 2 axes measure the same thing. For eg
			- [ ] Axis 1: Percentages; Axis 2: Absolute value
			- [ ] Axis 1: Celsius; Axis 2: Fahrenheit
- [ ] Geometries: Type of Plot (check below)
- [ ] Aesthetics
	- [ ] Position-X
	- [ ] Position-Y
	- [ ] Color
		- [ ] Discrete
		- [ ] Continuous
	- [ ] Size
	- [ ] Shape
	- [ ] Opacity
	- [ ] Animation (for Time)
- [ ] Data

## IDK

- Human visual system
	- detects differences, not absolute values
	- attracted to edges
		- designer should maximize contrast with background if outlines of shapes are important
	- perceives surface color base on edge contrast informations
	- higher contrast sensitivity in luminance than in chrominance 
	- color recognition is not an automatic process
		- stoop effect

## Cleveland's Visual Operations of Pattern Perception

1. Detection
2. Assembly
3. Estimation

## Gestalt Laws of Perpetual Organization

1. Emergence: mind sees the whole and then the parts. It often sees more than what is specifically states by its individual parts
2. Invariance: mind recognizes simple objects independent of rotation, translation, scale deformations, and lighting
3. Proximity: Elements closer together are perceived to be more related than elements farther apart
4. Similarity: Similar elements that are perceived to be more related than dissimilar elements
5. Enclosure: Elements enclosed together are perceived as belonging together
6. Continuity: Mind tries to continue visual, auditory, and kinetic patterns
7. Closure: Mind perceives set of individual elements as a single, recognizable pattern
8. Symmetry: Mind perceives objects as symmetrical shapes that form around their center
9. Figure-ground: elements are perceived as either figures (objects of focus) or ground (rest of the perceptual field)
10. Connection: Elements connected together (for eg: by a line) are perceived as belonging together
11. Common-fate: Elements that share a common fate (eg: moving in the same direction) are perceived as belonging together

## Tufte’s design principles for graphical excellence

1. Maximize the data-ink ratio, within reason
2. Mobilize every graphical element, perhaps several times over, to show the data
3. Maximize data density and the size of the data matrix, within reason
4. Establish context
5. Show cause and effect, where possible
6. Compare and contrast, utilize layering & separation
7. Escape flatland, use small multiples, parallel sequencing (reality is multivariate)
8. Show multiple dimensions
9. Utilize narratives of space and time
10. Integrate image, number and text

## Encoding Methods

From most effective to least effective

| Variable Type | Encoding                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Ordered       | Position on common scale    |
|               | Position on unaligned scale |
|               | Length (1D size)            |
|               | Tilt/Angle/Slope            |
|               | Area (2D size)              |
|               | Depth (3D position)         |
|               | Color Luminance             |
|               | Color Saturation            |
|               | Curvature                   |
