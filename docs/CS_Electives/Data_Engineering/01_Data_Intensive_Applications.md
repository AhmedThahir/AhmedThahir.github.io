# Databases

Data Model
- Relational model
- Document-based model
	- Not great for analytics
- Graph model

Aspects to keep in mind
- Data storage
- Data retrieval

## Structure

- Shallow dimension tables
- Dense fact tables

## Pipeline

- ETL
- ELT

## Code Compatibility

- Backward compatibility: Newer code can read data written by older code for old and new clients
- Forward Compatibility: Older code can read data written by newer code for old and new clients

## Rolling Upgrades

### Canary

```

## Replication

- Machine failures
- Latency for global audience
- Scale to large userbase
- Offline/network failures


Types
- Leader-Replica
	- Writes go to leader
	- Reads may/may not go to leader
	- Reads go to replica
- Multileader-Replica
- Leaderless
	- Write to all replicas
	- Read from all replicas
	- Eg: Amazon Dynamo, Voldemort, Cassandra

Aspects to consider
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous replication
- Replication lag
- Topology
- Durability vs availability vs latency
- Leader Failover
- Conflict resolution between leaders

## Database Partitioning

Sharding/Splitting/Horizontal Scaling
