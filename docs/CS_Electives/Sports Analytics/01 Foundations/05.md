# 2 Types of regression analyses

1. Predict $y$ using $x$
2. Forecast $y_{t+1}$ using $x_t$ and $y_t$

# Suggested Analysis Method

Let’s say you’re trying to analyze the correlation impact of $x$ on $y$

| Step                                                         | Leads to ___ of effect of $x$ on $y$ |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| First analyze obvious factors $x$                            | Over-estimation                      |
| Include omitted variables and lagged $x$                     | Under-estimation                     |
| Include heterogeneous effects<br />ie, the effect of being Manchester United | Hopefully accurate estimation        |

# Lagged Value

Note: This does not matter for `grangercausalitytests` library

```python
nba["wpc_lag"] = (
  nba
  .groupby("Team")
  ["wpc"]
  .shift(1)
)
```

# Fixed Effect

Helps understand the effect of history of a team.

ie, apart from other factors, does your position matter that you are Manchester United.

```python
regression = smf.ols(
	formula = "wpc ~ wpc_lag + relsal + C(Team, Treatment('Everton'))",
  data = NBA
).fit()
```
