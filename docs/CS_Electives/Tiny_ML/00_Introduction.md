#### ARM Cortex Processor Profiles

- ARM designs the processor core & ISA, but they don’t fabricate the chips
- The company (Qualcomm, Apple) bundles it with other design for system-on-chip
- The company (Google, Samsung, etc) places order to fabrication company (TSMC)

Costly for companies to use cloud-based systems; would prefer edge-computing to reduce their energy consumption

Can’t rely on material technology for performance: After a point in shrinking size of transistors to fit more on a single chip, side-effects (such as electrons shoot in unwanted directions) cause higher power usage. Hence, domain-specific H/W architectures (GPUs, TPUs) are important

#### Compute


#### Memory Allocation

Since products are expected to run for a long duration (months, years)
- memory allocation is very important
- need to guarantee that memory allocation will not end up fragmented
- Contiguous memory cannot be allocated even if there is enough memory overall

#### Memory Usage

![image-20240507101607915](./assets/image-20240507101607915.png)

- Need to be resource-aware
- Less compute
- Less memory
- Use quantization

### Storage

### Software

- Missing library features
	- Dynamic memory allocation is not always possible, to avoid running out of memory
- Limited OS system support; for eg: no `printf`

#### Operating System
Usually no Operating System, to save resources and enable specialization in the actual task

Sometimes there are OS
- Free RTOS
- arm MBED OS

Example of Android Platform Architecture in general purpose computer

#### Libraries

- Portability is a problem

#### Applications


### Model

There is a tradeoff between Accuracy and
1. Operations (usually, FLOPS)
2. Model size (usually, no of parameters)

Solutions
- Quantization
- Pruning
- Knowledge distillation
- AutoML

### Training Systems

- Pre/Post Processing
- Distributed training
- Federated learning

### Runtime/Inference Systems

Focused only on inference
- Less memory
- Less compute power
