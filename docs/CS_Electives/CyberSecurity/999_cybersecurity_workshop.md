## Why does Cyber Security Awareness Fails

- Complicated/Boring training content
- Poor Enforcement
- Lack of monitoring
- Unfocused awareness
- Point-in-Time Compliance
- Culture Misalignment
- Shared responsibility

## Solution

- Conventional vs UNconventional Thinking
- Policy vs Story telling
- Point-in-Time Assessment vs Continuous monitoring
- Compliance vs Culture
- Single-Unit vs Cross-Functional Team

Awareness has to fun and exciting, not like work.

## Using Virtual Machine

If you isolate your virtual machine from your OS, you **may** get away even in the case of an attack.

## Zero Day Vulnerability

Zero day vulnerability is something that was not known before.

## Phases of Cyber Kill Chain

The earlier you detect, the better

- Reconnaisance

  - Observation

  - Attacker identifies a target and explores vulnerabilities

  - > The one who knows their enemy more than themselves wins the war.
    >
    > If you don’t know how someone will attack you, then you can’t protect yourself.

  - Learn to attack so you can defend yourself

- Weaponization

  - Develop ‘ammunition’

  - Create a payload/malware

  - This is the only thing the defender has no control over, as it is in the attacker’s hands

- Delivery

  - Send the payload to the intended target

  - Social Engineering

  - Web Proxy helps protect users

- Exploitation

  - Malicious explotaition is executed within the victim’s system

  - Reverse shell is a response to a shell

- Installation

- C&C

  - Command and Control of system resources

- Action & Objectives


1 attacker and many victims leads to a bot(something)

## Cyber Threat Intelligence

The first phrase people say when something happens is ‘failure of intelligence’

- Strategy is long-term
- Tactics is short-term

### Fundamentals

1. Intel Planning/Strategy
2. Data Collection & Aggegration
3. Threat Analytics
4. Intel Uage & Dissemination

## Dark Web

- Gives illusion of anonymity
- Gives you access to information

### Onion Network

Be careful when using Tor

Most Tor networks are actually the host of the network, so they are infact monitored.

## Types of Malware

| Type                 | Meaning |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| Backdoor             |         |
| Botnet               |         |
| Downloader           |         |
| Information-Stealing |         |

Really skilled hackers won’t even be known.

> Any field you are in, you should learn the terminologies.

> Never believe you know everything; keep learning

> Keep an open-mind always; don’t go with a bank mindset to another field.

> Always see if you get importance in your organizations. But then again, if you do get importance, never let it get to your head.

> You may not certificates/acknowledgment, but don’t let it get to your head.

> Success will won’t teach much; only failure will teach

> The only time you can stop learning is “when you’re 6ft under”

> You should be able to adapt to any situation.

- It is not safe to swipe your credit card, as the magnetic stripe is **not** encrypted
- It is safer to either
  - insert your card, and use the encrypted Electro-Magnetic chip
  - or, tap it and use NFC

Be careful about scams. A bank would never ask you for your credit card details.

## Security Assessment

We need to test our tools before attackers do.

## DDOS

A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is **an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users**. DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash.

## Risk Rating and Prioritization

## Where to Start

NICE (National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education) Framework

- Employers
- Learners
- Something

There are lists of required skills and knowledge

## Something

Data protection is needed to protect only for outgoing **confidential** data.

- It is not feasible to protect all data

Importance/Confidentiality of data varies over time

- Exam questions are important for uni **before** exam
- **After** exam, it is not important

## Biggest Risks

- Human Errors
- Insider threats
- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)
- Public Networks
  - Especially in airports, where they harvest user data
  - Even your user-id and password will go through the public access point
  - Even https is not free from this risk
- Charging Ports
  - Using a ‘dumb intermediary’ (such as power bank) prevents this

- Something you are 
- Something you know (childhood bestfriend)

## AAA Principles

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Accountability/Auditing
  - Authorized person has access to authorized resources only at authorized times

## Access Control Models

- Discretionary Access Control
- Mandatory Access Control
- Rule-Based Access Control
- Attribute-Based Access Control
- Role-Based Control
  - Most common in companies

## Identity Life Cycle Management

## Segregation of Duties
