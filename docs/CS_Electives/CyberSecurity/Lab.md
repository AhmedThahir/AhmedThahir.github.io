We can see what ports are open

# Telnet vs SSH(Secure SHell)

Telnet(Port 23) is unencrypted and insecure, as all traffic occurs in cleartext.

Block any service on Port 23 of the server.

If you see that port 23 is being used

```bash
telnet 172.16.22.5
```

All traffic will be in plain text.

```bash
ssh 2020A7PS0198U@172.16.22.5
```

All traffic will be encrypted.
