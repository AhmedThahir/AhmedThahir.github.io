| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Power-Usage | Low              | High                 |
| Type        | Continuous       |                      |
| Location    | On-Device        | On-Device/<br>Online |

## Types

|     | Single Shot         | Streaming                 |
| --- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
|     | Only keyword spoken | Keyword within a sentence |

## Model

Spectrogram is just an image

### TinyConv

Since we only we are only focused on recognizing a few keywords, we can just use One Conv2D followed by single dense layer

```mermaid
flowchart LR

Input --> Conv --> FC --> Softmax --> Output
```

#### Limitations
- Limited vocabulary
- Lower accuracy
- Limited UX

## Cascading

## Multiple Inferences

- Average inferences across multiple time slices

This is to avoid False Positives for group of words. For eg:
- No
	- No good
	- Notion
	- Notice
	- Notable
