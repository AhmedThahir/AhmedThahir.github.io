## Probability And NaÃ¯ve Bayes

Kindly go through [Bayes' Theorem in Probability and Statistics](./../../1_Core/Probability_%26_Statistics/02_Bayes_Theorem.md)

## Bayesian Network

Represents the dependence between variables

- Nodes - represents variables
- Links - X points to Y, implies X has direct influence over Y or X is a parent of Y
- CPT - each node has a conditional probability distribution which determines the effect of the parent on that node

### Joint Probability Distribution

$P(X_i|X_{i-1},........., X_1) = P(X_i |Parents(X_i ))$


### Independence in BN

$X {\perp \!\!\! \perp} Y | Z$ is read as $X$ is conditionally independent of $Y$ given $Z$

1. Casual chains

```mermaid
  graph LR;
    A((A))-->B((B));
    B((B))-->C((C));
```
In such a configuration, A is guaranteed to be independent of C given B

2. Common Cause

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    B((B))-->A((A));
    B((B))-->C((C));
```

In such a configuration, A is guaranteed to be independent of C given B

3. Common effect

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A((A))-->C((C));
    B((B))-->C((C));
```

In such a configuration, A is guaranteed to be independent of B.  
But A and B are not independent given C.

### Active Triples

```mermaid
  graph LR;
    A((" "))-->B((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
``` 
```mermaid
  graph TD;
    B((" "))-->A((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
```
```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A((" "))-->C((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
    style C fill : #808080
```
```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A((" "))-->C((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
    C((" "))-.->D((" "))
    style D fill : #808080
```

### Inactive Triples

```mermaid
  graph LR;
    A((" "))-->B((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
    style B fill : #808080
``` 

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    B((" "))-->A((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
    style B fill : #808080
```

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A((" "))-->C((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
```

_NOTE : All possible configurations for active and inactive triples are listed above_
