## Probability And Na√Øve Bayes

- Probability of disjunction - $P(A \vee B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \wedge B)$

- Conditional Probability - $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \wedge B)}{P(B)}$

- Independence - Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if $P(A \wedge B) = P(A)P(B)$

### Bayes' theorem 
It determines the probability of an event with uncertain knowledge.  
<br>
$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$  
<br>
where $P(A|B)$ is known as posterior,  
$P(B|A)$ is called the likelihood,  
$P(A)$ is called the prior probability and  
$P(B)$ is called marginal probability 

The equation can be generalized as  
$P(A_i|B) = \frac{P(B|A_i)P(A_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^k P(B|A_i)P(A_i)}$  
where $A_1, A_2, A_3,........, A_n$ are all mutually exclusive events


## Bayesian Network

Represents the dependence between variables

- Nodes - represents variables
- Links - X points to Y, implies X has direct influence over Y or X is a parent of Y
- CPT - each node has a conditional probability distribution which determines the effect of the parent on that node

### Joint Probability Distribution

$P(X_i|X_{i-1},........., X_1) = P(X_i |Parents(X_i ))$


### Independence in BN

$X {\perp \!\!\! \perp} Y | Z$ is read as $X$ is conditionally independent of $Y$ given $Z$

1. Casual chains

```mermaid
  graph LR;
    A((A))-->B((B));
    B((B))-->C((C));
```
In such a configuration, A is guaranteed to be independent of C given B

2. Common Cause

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    B((B))-->A((A));
    B((B))-->C((C));
```

In such a configuration, A is guaranteed to be independent of C given B

3. Common effect

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A((A))-->C((C));
    B((B))-->C((C));
```

In such a configuration, A is guaranteed to be independent of B.  
But A and B are not independent given C.

### Active Triples

```mermaid
  graph LR;
    A((" "))-->B((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
``` 
```mermaid
  graph TD;
    B((" "))-->A((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
```
```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A((" "))-->C((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
    style C fill : #808080
```
```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A((" "))-->C((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
    C((" "))-.->D((" "))
    style D fill : #808080
```

### Inactive Triples

```mermaid
  graph LR;
    A((" "))-->B((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
    style B fill : #808080
``` 

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    B((" "))-->A((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
    style B fill : #808080
```

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A((" "))-->C((" "));
    B((" "))-->C((" "));
```
