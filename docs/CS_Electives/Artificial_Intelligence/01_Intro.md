## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence ( abbreviated as AI ) can be defined as a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which are capable of behaving, thinking and making decisions like a human.

### Key areas of AI :
1. Machine Learning
2. Natural Language Processing
3. Robotics
4. Object Detection
5. Speech Recognition

### AI has advanced in various domains :
1. Fashion and Art
2. Science
3. Games
4. Music and Sounds
5. Videos and Images  
6. Business and Finance
7. Security and Safety and the list goes on...


Artificial Intelligence is the superset of all other forms of smart machine learning algorithms and models.

### But why Artificial Intelligence

- Replicate human intelligence to provide precise decisions and outcomes
- Solve knowledge-intensive tasks to reduce human workload
- Establish an intelligent connection of perception and action
