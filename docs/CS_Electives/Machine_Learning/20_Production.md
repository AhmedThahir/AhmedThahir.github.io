| Concept Drift | ❌           | ✅                   |                            | $p(y \vert x)$ | - Give higher sample weight to recent datapoints<br>- Use batch-streaming hybrid<br>  - Works when we have the label associated with every data point, such as in Recommender Systems | Price-elasticity of demand changes | New competitor in your existing market |

Check with
- Adversarial Validation/Domain Classifier
- Anomaly Detection

- If label and drift happen together and cancel each other out, there is no concept drift.
- Else, concept drift will be caused by one/both since they are linked by Bayes'  equation

## Adversarial Attacks

Fool model by adding noise

![](assets/adversarial_attacks_cnn.png)

This is not a problem with Deep Learning and/or ConvNets. Same issue comes up with Neural Networks in any other modalities. Primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability adversarial perturbation is their linear nature (and very high-dimensional, sparsely-populated input spaces).

The exact adversarial noise can easily be learnt
- known model weights: directly
- unknown model weights: through backpropagation

eg: Confidently predicting the class even though it is extrapolating

![](assets/nn_adversarial_reason_classification.png)

Solution
- Data augmentation; not sufficient
- Train for adversarial robustness; not sufficient
	1. Create adversarial examples
	2. Add them to train data, tagged as "adversarial class"
- Not clear what is the guaranteed workaround
