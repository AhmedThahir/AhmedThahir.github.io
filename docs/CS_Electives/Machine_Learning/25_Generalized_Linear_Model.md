# Generalized Linear Model

Why? For non-normal distribution, OLS $\ne$ MLE

Steps

1. Let $y$ have a probability distributions as long as it is from the exponential family

   - Included

     - Normal, log-normal, exponential, gamma, chi-squared, beta, Bernoulli, poisson, binomial, etc

   - Not included:

     - Studentâ€™s $t$ due to heavy tails

     - Mixed distributions (with different location/scale parameters)

2. Allow for any transformation (link function) of $y$, such that transformation is monodic and differentiable

3. Write linear parameters

4. Derive MLE

| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Bernoulli/<br />Binomial | Outcome of single yes/no occurence                 | Logit<br />(Logistic) | $\ln \left \vert \dfrac{y}{1-y} \right \vert$ |

| Poisson                  | Count of occurrences in fixed amount of time/space | Log                   | $\ln \vert y \vert$                           |
