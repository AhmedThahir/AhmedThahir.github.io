## Key Areas

1. Machine Learning
2. Natural Language Processing
3. Robotics
4. Object Detection
5. Speech Recognition

## Applications

1. Fashion and Art
2. Science
3. Games
4. Music and Sounds
5. Videos and Images  
6. Business and Finance
7. Security and Safety and the list goes on...

## Why AI?

- Replicate human intelligence to provide precise decisions and outcomes
- Solve knowledge-intensive tasks to reduce human workload
- Establish an intelligent connection of perception and action

## Types

There are 2 types of artificial intelligence

|              |                         ANI                         |               AGI               |
| :----------: | :-------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
|  Full form   |           Artificial Narrow Intelligence            | Artificial General Intelligence |
|   Concept    | Specific Task<br />eg: Self-driving car, web search |   Do anything a human can do    |
| Advancements |                        Rapid                        |              Slow               |

## Limitations

Don’t be too optimistic or pessimistic about AI

1. Performance
2. Explainability
   
   AI finds it hard to justify its decisions
3. Biases due to biased data
4. Attacks on AI
5. Adverse use of AI
