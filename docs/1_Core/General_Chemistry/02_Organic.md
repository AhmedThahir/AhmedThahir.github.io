    - **Addition reactions**
        
        These reactions are exothermic because the electron density around the carbon atoms becomes polarized, making them more commercially viable.
        
        - **Addition reactions**
            - **Addition rxn general mechanism**
                - Since carbocation is preferred stability is 3>2>1
                - Order of reactivity of Hydrogen halides is HF<<<<HCl<HI where HI is the fastest because its always polarized

                - [ ]  Markovnikovs rule
                    - Product with more branches is preferred
                    - H goes to Carbon atom with more Hydrogen ( rich becomes richer ) and the product we get is the major product
                    - major requires lower Gibbs free energy
                    - Both back side and front side attack is possible therefore this results in the formation of a racemic mixture of two possible enantiomers, since the addition can occur from either side of the double bond.

                    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMcCvD5dDMU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMcCvD5dDMU) explains this
                    
                    Basically, Chain initiation happens first where bond is broken and we get roh and Br
                    
                    and then propogation happens where the Br we got from before  attacks to form a stable carbocation which is then attacked by HBR again to provide the hydrogen

                The hydration dehydration equilibria is altered

                💡SHORTCUT :- if there are even no. of electron pairs then we will get n as a fraction therefore not aromatic or we can say it does not obey huckels rule , if odd then its aromatic

                **IMPORTANT** :- Here it follows huckels rule because we are counting the lone pair from -ve charge also as an e- pair
                
            - There are 3 classes :- Aromatic , Anti Aromatic and non aromatic
                
                Aromatic and Anti aromatic they both look the same but one follows huckels rule and the other does not
                
                Non aromatic don't follow all 4 properties

            - Heterocyclic aromatic compounds are compounds where not all are carbon atoms
                
                They want to be aromatic which means it wants to resonate 
                
                check if the atom is participating in resonance or not , if its participating with a pi bond you don't add the electrons in , if its not participating you use the lone pair
                
                (or) if the atom has a pi bond you dont use the lone pair , if it does not have a pi bond you use the lone pair , if it has 2 lone pairs you use only one

                we are not using the lone pair , that is why we wont count it in the huckel rule and get it as aromatic and not anti-aromatic

            order is pyridine>pyrolidene>pyrole not pyridene>pyrole>pyrolidene
            
            depends on basicity which depends on the no. of lp
            
            if we look at pyridine and pyrole , if we dont consider the lp it is less basic then pyrole , but because of the presence of lp it is more basic as it has more donating power now
            
            similarly, if we look at pyrole and pyrolidene pyrolidine will be more basic than pyrole because pyrole has less donating power as its lone pair is being used

        - **Energy**
            
            •  **Torsional strain is an increase in energy caused by electron-electron repulsions between the eclipsing C-H bonds**
            
            Why is staggered more stable than eclipse?

            **The chair conformation is very stable because it eliminates angle strain  and torsional strain (all hydrogens on adjacent C atoms are staggered)**

            Axial is less stable than Equatorial pos because it minimizes steric repulsion
            
            ![Untitled 122](https://github.com/SivaaB/EmailSender/assets/74814237/373ad3d1-e689-4014-b168-c5f53c0f2140)
            
            Axial becomes Equatorial and vice versa
            numbering changes  
            
            up stays up and down stays down they dont change
            
            ![Untitled 123](https://github.com/SivaaB/EmailSender/assets/74814237/6dfa632b-252e-4114-93b2-e8f1c37257d9)
            if we go from form A to B the numbering shifts to the next carbon clockwise
            
            if vice versa then numbering shifts back and anti clockwise
            
            The bigger arrow shows that the equilibrium favors the more stable product

            bulky group on equatorial thats why more stable than bulky group on axial
