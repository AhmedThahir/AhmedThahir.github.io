# Math 1

This course focuses on the essential role of vector calculus in science and engineering, highlighting its application in modeling dynamic problems through differential and integral equations. Students will explore functions of several variables, which are increasingly relevant in scientific contexts compared to single-variable functions, as well as the complex interactions of these variables.

The course aims to deepen understanding of the derivatives and integrals of multivariable functions, with applications spanning probability, fluid dynamics, electrical sciences, and more.
