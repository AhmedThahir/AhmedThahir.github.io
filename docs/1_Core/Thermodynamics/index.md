# Thermodynamics

Taught by Dr. Shashank Khurana, Asst HOD of Mechanical Eng Dept.

This course provides a thorough exploration of thermodynamics, focusing on the principles governing energy, matter, and their interactions. Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing processes, devices, and systems that effectively utilize energy and matter in engineering applications.

Key topics include the laws of conservation of energy, as well as the utilization of heat and workâ€”two fundamental forms of energy in transition. The course delves into the laws of thermodynamics as they apply to both control mass and control volume systems, highlighting the significance of irreversibility and availability in thermodynamic system design. Additionally, students will learn to use standard charts and tables of properties to aid in numerical problem-solving, reinforcing their grasp of the material through practical applications.
