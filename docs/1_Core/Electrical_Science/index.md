# Electrical Science

Iâ€™ve got the notes for these, but need someone to digitize them.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of electrical sciences, focusing on circuit analysis, electrical machines, electronic devices, and digital electronics. Understanding these core topics is essential for students pursuing electrical and electronic engineering, as they form the foundation for advanced studies in the field.

The course covers key learning objectives, including basic circuit elements and laws, circuit analysis techniques, and relevant theorems. Students will explore the behavior of circuits with energy-storing elements, three-phase circuits, and magnetic circuits. Additionally, the course delves into transformers, the principles of DC and AC machines, semiconductor fundamentals, and the operation of various devices, including bipolar junction transistors and field-effect transistors (FETs). Operational amplifiers and the basics of digital circuits are also included, providing students with a well-rounded understanding of electrical engineering concepts and their applications.
