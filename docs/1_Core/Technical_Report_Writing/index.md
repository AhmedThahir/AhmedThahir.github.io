# Technical Report Writing

This course has been divided into 2 sub-components. One is Part - A which will be taught by Dr. Shazi (mostly focuses on sentences, effective writing, preparing questionnaries) and Part - B will taught by Dr. Sayantan (mostly focusses on paragraph writing, ieee citations) 

As of date the notes cover up to midsem, they were made with the intention to serve as final revision points and not comprehensive notes.
