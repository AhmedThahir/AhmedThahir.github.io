# Computer Programming

This was very similar to the C++ course in CBSE 11th/12th, so haven't made detailed notes for this course, yet. Some basics have been provided though. 

The primary goals of this course are to introduce:

- Basic data representation and processing within a computer.
- Techniques for specifying data, operations, and problem-solving using a programming language.
- Systematic approaches for program construction.

The course covers topics such as:

- Basic Model of a Computer
- Problem Solving: Basic Computing Steps and Flow Charting (Assignment, Sequencing, Conditionals, Iteration)
- Programming Constructs: Expressions, Statements, Conditionals, Loops, Functions/Procedures
- Data Types: Primitive Types, Tuples, Unions, Lists/Arrays, Pointers, and Dynamically Allocated Data
- Input, Output, and Files

## Labs

This junior's repository [SivaaB/BITSPil-CSF111](https://github.com/SivaaB/BITSPil-CSF111) contains solutions to all the lab and tutorial sheets given in class. Thank you Sivaa! âœ¨

I will also be adding my lab codes in this folder. Later, based on user feedback, we can filter to the simplest codes.
