## Preparation and Charecterization of Aspirin

1. Weigh 2g of Salicylic Acid. Transfer it to a dry 100mL beaker. 
2. 4mL of Acetic Anhydride into 100mL beaker. 
3. 5 Drops of conc. H2SO4 into 100ml beaker. [If excess H2SO4 is added the reaction gets suphonated and no product is formed.]
4. Water Bath - Reaction mixture below the liquid level in the bath and water in boiling condition, continue for 20 mins. 
5. Add 10mL ice cold water, to hyrolyze the unreacted acetic anhydride. 
6. Chill in ice bath - occasionally swirling to cause precipitation. 
7. Add 25mL ice cold water. 
8. Scratch side of beaker with stirring rod to initialize crystallization. 
9. Filter, Dry, Weigh, Report. 
10. Report melting point.
