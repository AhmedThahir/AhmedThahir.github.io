## Estimation of Ferrous Sulphate by Permanganometry

1. Weigh 1.4g of FeSO4.7H2O on watch glass. 
2. Transfer this amount into a 100mL volumetric flask. Add 10mL of dil. H2SO4
3. Add enough volume of distilled water to the flask to make it reach the mark. 
4. Calculate the Molarity of this solution. 

1. Fill the burette with KMnO4 Solution till 0. 
2. Pipette 25mL of this standard solution in a conical flask. Add 10mL of silute H2SO4 to this. 
3. Titrate till a light pink color is observed. Repeat twice for two concordant readings. 

1. Repeat this for the unknown solution.
