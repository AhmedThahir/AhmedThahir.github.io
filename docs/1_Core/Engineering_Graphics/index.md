# Engineering Graphics

This course has two parts, Part - 1 includes orthographic projections, isometric projections and straight lines. Part - 2 comes after midsem -- for compre only Part 2 is concerned.

A problem set wiith questions from the textbook are given a week before midsems which are really helpful for preparation. The solutions to those problems have been provided by this junior's repository [SivaaB/BITSPil-CSF111](https://github.com/SivaaB/BITSPil-CSF111). Thank you Sivaa! âœ¨
