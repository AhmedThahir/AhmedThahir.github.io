# Engineering Graphics

This course aims to equip students with the techniques and standard practices of technical drawing to effectively communicate and produce design ideas. It covers the theories of projection and the fundamentals of engineering drawing, utilizing AutoCAD, a widely used CAD application software. Students will be introduced to and emphasized on basic AutoCAD commands throughout the course.

The course has two parts, Part - 1 (for midsem) includes orthographic projections, isometric projections and straight lines. Part - 2 (for compre) includes projection of lines + solids, sectional view of solids and cutting of solids. 

A problem set wiith questions from the textbook are given a week before midsems and compre which are really helpful for preparation. The solutions to those problems have been provided by this junior's repository [SivaaB/BITSPil-CSF111](https://github.com/SivaaB/BITSPil-CSF111). Thank you Sivaa! âœ¨
