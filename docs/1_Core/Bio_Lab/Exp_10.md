## Preparation of Onion Root Tip Slide for Calculation of Mitotic Index [No Microscope] -- [Mandatory!!!]

1. Clean slide and cover slip
2. Place onion root tip on the slide
3. 2-3 drops of HCl on the onion root tip such that it is fully covered. Let this remain for 15 minutes. Wipe it off gently once done. 
4. Wipe it off gently, and use nuclear stain (in our case -- Saffranin Blue), this imparts a pink color on the slide. Let this remain for 15 minutes. Wipe it off gently once done. 
5. Put a drop of water on the root tip and cover it uisng a cover slip, make sure to place the cover slip in a such a manner that there are no air bubbles. Remove the excess stain using a tissue. 
6. Gently tap the root tip using a pencil to produce a squashed homogenous effect.
