## Stomata [400x]

### Dicot Plant: 

1. We need lower epidermis, use cutter to isolate the tissue. 
2. Put one drop water and place the tissue. 
3. Now place cover slip in a tilted way such that there are no air bubbles. 
4. Now view it under microscope on 40x (4, 10, 40) magnification. 

Similar procedure for monocot except there is no upper and lower epidermis, either side works.  

To calculate the stomatal density: 

- Count the number of stomata in 3 different "fields" [x2, one for Monocot and other for Dicot]. 
- Take the average of the 3 fields, and multiply it by 8 that will give you the stomatal density per mm^2. 

Q. Why are we multiplying by 8?
