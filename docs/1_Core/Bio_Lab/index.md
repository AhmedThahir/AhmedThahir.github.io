# Lab

The Biology Laboratory course introduces first-year engineering students to essential experimental techniques in microscopy, micrometry, haemometry, cytometry, DNA isolation, chromatography, and spectrophotometry.

**Objectives:**
- Familiarize students with key experiments in core biology.
- Enhance understanding of underlying biological theories.
- Develop skills in experimental methodology and scientific instrument operation.
- Integrate theoretical knowledge with practical applications.

Here is the demonstration of every experiment in the biology lab. As of now I have only uploaded till midsem. 

PS : Please note that the links to videos on GDrive have been removed at the moment as they have been removed by the faculty. Once reuplaoded, will add them.
