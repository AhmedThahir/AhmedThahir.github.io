## Micrometry [100x]

1. Place the calibration slide on the stage of the microscope. 
2. View the slide under 4x and 10x. 
3. Remove the light side lens, and place the ocular scale eyepiece on the right side lens. 
4. Observe which divisions correspond exactly with the divisions on the stage micrometer. 
5. Least Count of Stage of Micrometer is 0.01mm = 0.1 MicroMeter. 
6. Calculate the Calibration Constant: 
- CC = (No. of Divisions in Stage Micrometer between two adjacent coincident points * Least Count) / Corr. no. of divisions on Ocular Microscope. 

### Measuring specimens: 
1. Measure the Length and the Breadth of one cell of the given sample. Multuply the measured paramters by your calibration constant to obtain the final readings that in MicroMeters.
