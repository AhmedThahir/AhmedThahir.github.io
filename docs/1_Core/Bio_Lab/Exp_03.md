## Calculation of Mitotic Index [400x]

1. Examine under 400x magnification. 
2. Pick a fieid where there's atleast one prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase. Count the total number of each type of cell. 
3. Identification : 
- Prophase - Raisin, 
- Metapahse - Concentrated in Center
- Anaphase - Concentrated in Sides
- Telophase - Raisins towards the edges. 
4. Go the center of the "field" count the number of cells in row an column with max count, multiplying those two numbers will give you the total cell count. Sum of the cells in phase can also be obtained. 
5. Number of Cells in Interphase = Total - Cells in Phase 
6. Find their corresponding percentages. 
7. Calculations: 
- Mitotic Index = Number of Cells in Phase / Totoal Number of Cells.
- Generalized Version : Mitotic Index * 19 Hours
- Index of Cells = Number of Cells in that Phase / Total number of Cells in Phase
- Duration of Mitosis = Mitotic Index * Index of Cells
