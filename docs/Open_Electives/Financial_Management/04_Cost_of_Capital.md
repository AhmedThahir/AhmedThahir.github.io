Depends primarily on the use of funds, not the source, because every investment has a different risk associated with it.

Debt is almost always the cheapest source of capital, but has some trouble associated with it. This will be covered in a future topic.

It is always calculated as WACC (Weighted average cost of capital)

Lower the WACC the better

| Alias Name                  | Perspective of |
| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| Required return             | Investor       |
| Appropriate discount rate   | Firm           |
| Compound rate               | Calculations   |
| Opportunity cost of capital | idk            |

## Uses

1. WACC is used to value the entire firm
2. Evaluate return for projects
3. Evaluate performance of firm

## Some Notes

- Growing companies have high WACC, as they have risks associated with them
- It is better if WACC decreases over time

## Calculation

$$
\begin{align}
\text{WACC} 
= \quad
& w_d  \times k_d (1-\tau) \\
+ & w_{ps} \times k_{ps} \\
+ & w_{cs} \times k_{cs}
\end{align}
$$

| Term     | Meaning                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| $w_d$    | Proportion of debt              |
| $w_{ps}$ | Proportion of preference shares |
| $w_{cs}$ | Proportion of common shares     |
| $k_d$    | Cost of debt                    |
| $k_{ps}$ | Cost of preference shares       |
| $k_{cs}$ | Cost of common shares           |
| $\tau$   | Tax rate                        |

Interest is tax-deductable, hence it gives ‘tax shield’
