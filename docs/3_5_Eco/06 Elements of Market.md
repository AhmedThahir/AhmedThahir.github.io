## Elements of Market

1. Demand
2. Supply
3. Equilibrium

## Demand

indicates **optimal** quantity of commodities which consumers are willing and able to buy at a particular price, in a particular period

if prices change, demand also changes

### Law of Demand

Assuming every factor (like preferences, current state affairs) remains constant, $\text{demand} \propto \frac{1}{\text{price}}$
this goes other way round too

### Individual Demand Curve

can vary from one individual to another even for the same commodity, due to factors of trade (1st note) [Factors of trade](01/#Factors of trade)

graph is a straight line with a negative slope

- x = Demand
- y = price

Be careful of the slope, cuz the slope formula is for the inversed graph of the demand Curve
Slope $= \frac 1 {\alpha_2}$

$$
\text{Demand as a function of price}\\
\begin{align}
D &= f(P) \\&= \alpha_1 - \alpha_2 P \\
\alpha_2 &= -\frac{\partial D}{\partial P}
\end{align}
$$

- $x =$ demand
- $P =$ price
- $\alpha_1 =$ the demand even the commodity is free

    - impact of all other factors that affect the demand 
    - income of consumers
    - advertising etc 
- $\alpha_2 =$ sensitivity of demand with respect to price
  the no of units of demand decreases by when the price increases by 1 unit
    - necessities have low sensitivity
    - luxury goods have high sensitivity

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Slope of graph | $\to 0$                                                      | $\to \infty$                                                 |
| $\alpha_2$     | $\to \infty$                                                 | $\to 0$                                                      |
| sensitivity    | High                                                         | Low                                                          |
|                | even a small change in price will cause variation in demand  | even large changes in price cause negligible change in demand |
| Example        | when there are too many sellers and buyers; and only one seller changes the price | medicines, food                                              |

### Market Demand

total demand for a commodity in a market at a particular price

summation of individual demands for commodity at particular prices

### Giffen Goods

Law of demand not applicable for them

eg: BW TVs, Nokia Phone

$\text{demand} \propto \text{price}$

## Factors of Demand

Out of the following factors, economic policies mainly target the expectations factor

$$
x_1 = 
\alpha
- \alpha_1 p
\pm \alpha_2 M
\pm \alpha_3 W
\pm \alpha_4 M^e
\pm \alpha_5 p^e
+ \alpha_6 A
$$

### Income and Wealth

More income and wealth means more spending and hence, higher demand

income is flow of money currently
wealth is what we have accumulated over time

#### +ve

eg: luxury items

individual demand curve will have a rightward shift; ie greater consumption at same price

#### neutral

inelastic demand

eg: food

#### -ve

individual demand curve will have a leftward shift; ie lower consumption at same price

inferior and giffen goods

#### Superior good

if the demand inc with inc in income

Eg: smartphones,  LEDs, cars

#### Necessities

inelastic

Eg: Rice

#### Inferior

if the demand dec with inc in income

eg: B/W TV, tungsten bulbs, public transport

### Price of Other goods

Cross Price is measured by $\alpha_3$

when price of complimentary good increases, the demand of main commodity decreases
when price of substitute good increases, the demand of main commodity increases

hence, if

- $\alpha_3 > 0$ substitute
- $\alpha_3 < 0$ complimentary

#### Complimentary goods

are goods that are consumed together

eg: car and petrol

#### Substitute Goods

substitute for each other

Eg: Pepsi and coke

### Tastes/Preferences

idk how to write this

### Expectations

- expected price - what I predict to be the price of the commodity in the future
    - if expected price > current price, then demand increases
    - which ends up increasing the price; whether or not it would’ve happened naturally, nobody will know :laughing:
      here, our expectations clearly affects the actual outcome
    - if expected price < current price, then demand decreases
- expected income - what I predict to be my income in the future

### Market Size

no of buyers

more the buyers, greater the demand

### Advertising

does not affect the product, but only changes the perception of the product in consumers’ heads

better the advertising, greater the demand

### Season/Time of the Year

- demand for cotton is greater in summer
- demand for wool is greater in winter

## Supply

is the **optimal** quantity which sellers are willing and able to sell at a given price, in a particular period

## Law of Supply

Assuming that factors are same, supply $\propto$ selling price of commodity

### Contemporary Relation

$S = \beta_1 + \beta_2 P_{t}$

- land
- eggs
- milk

### Lagged Relation

$S = \beta_1 + \beta_2 P_{t-1}$

for commodities with large gestation period

agricultural

### Terms

- $\beta_1 =$ minimum selling price for which suppliers are willing to produce commodity
- $\beta_2 =$ sensitivity of supply wrt price

### Graph

- y = P
- x = S

Outward shift means greater supply for the same price
inward shift means lower supply for the same price

All points on the supply curve show the optimal supplies
any point inside/outside the supply curve will not provide maximum profit

### Individual Supply

every firm has different supply curve due to difference in cost structures

greater the scale, lower the cost (due to Benefits of Scale)

### Market Supply

total supply for a commodity in a market at a particular price

summation of supplies of commodity by different firms at particular prices

## Factors of Supply

$$
S = \beta_1 + \beta_2 P + \beta_3 F + \beta_4 T + \beta_5 E
$$

### Cost of Production

input prices, technology

if cost inc, supply dec

### Expectations

- if expected price/returns > current price, then supply increases
- else supply decreases

### Price of related products

$S \propto \frac{1}{p_r}$

if price of raw materials, transport and complimentary goods like oil increase, then supply decreases

### Number of Sellers

$S \propto n$

greater the no of sellers, greater the market supply

### Producer Sentiments

mindset of producers

- if it is positive, then supply increases
- else supply decreases

## Market Equilibrium

market situation when price has reached the level where
quantity supplied = quantity demand

no tendency for change in price/decisions, as both producers and consumers are satisfied

in the long run, excess demand and supply tends to 0

Auctions take place until equilibrium is reached

### Evaluating Equilibrium Price/Quantity

1. Get $P$ by equating demand and supply functions and solving them
2. Get $Q$ by substituting $P$ in either function
   (both gives the same answer)

we can also draw a graph and obtain the point of interception of the supply and demand curves

![Equilibrium](img/equilibrium.svg)

### Dis-equilibrium

Whenever there is a disequilibrium, the market automatically adjusts the price

- Surplus (excess supply/low demand) when 
    - actual price > equilibrium price
    - buyers do not want to buy
    - actual price will reduce to equilibrium price automatically, as there is low demand
- Shortage (excess demand/low supply) when 
    - actual price < equilibrium price
    - sellers do not want to sell
    - only those who are willing and able to continue buying do so; others stop buying
    - actual price will increase to equilibrium price automatically, as there is low supply

Automatic market correction mechanism always occurs, given that

1. prices are flexible
2. market free from government intervention
3. both buyers and sellers are equally-informed about the market
    (internet has helped with making information symmetric)
    otherwise there will be one or more of the following
    - sellers will manipulate buyers
    - all the sellers will be selling bad products, as it more profitable to do so
    - company recruiters will only get bad candidates as the salary they provide will be amazing for bad candidates, but too low for good candidates
    so only the bad candidates will end up accepting the job
    - buyers will be hesitant to pay higher price, even when the seller is justified to ask that much

#### Govt

Black market (not the illegal market one) is a market that sells commodity at price cheaper than govt-issued price

Whenever there is govt intervention in market dis-equilibrium, there will be always be a tendency for the existence of a parallel black market

### Events

1. Determine if the event changes the demand/supply
2. Determine the shift in the curves
3. Find how the equilibrium price and quantity are affected

### Change in Equilibrium

[Equilibrium Geogebra](demo/equilibrium.ggb)

rightward/leftward shift of the demand and supply curve is due to change in factors other than price
change in the constant

angular upward/downward shift is due to change in price
change in the coefficient of price

Imagine an auction

|              | Supply const       | Supply inc              | Supply dec              |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| demand const | P same<br />Q same | P ⬇<br />Q ⬆            | P ⬆<br />Q ⬇            |
| demand inc   | P ⬆<br />Q ⬆       | P ambiguous<br />Q ⬆    | P ⬆<br />Q ambiguous    |
| demand dec   | P ⬇<br />Q ⬇       | P ⬇<br />Q ambiguous    | P ambiguous<br />Q ⬇    |

ambiguous –> it depends on the relative change bw the supply and demand

## Misc

### Black Money

the money isn’t illegal

the problem is that the transaction is invalid

the transaction was not recorded to avoid paying taxes for the transaction

### Demonetization

they assumed that all black wealth is in the form of cash
but if you look at data, 0.0002% of total wealth is in the form of cash, and only around 1% of black wealth is in cash

demerits were the cost of

- printing the notes
- time of people in queues wasted and hence they did not perform productively
- because of the above, informal sector shops lost everything

it did only one thing, one more commodity got introduced: old currency lol ahahah :laughing:

Fake currency is only an issue if it facilitates illegal activities.
However, as long as fake currency is used for legal activities, then there is no problem from the perspective of economics.
But at the same time, if the proportion of fake money increases, then there is fear of inflation
