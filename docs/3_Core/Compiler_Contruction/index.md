# Compiler Construction

Course taught by Dr. Santhosh Kumar, Dr. Elakkiya and Dr. Vijaykumar

This course is a continuation of Theory of Computation and Principles of Programming Languages, and covers the essential phases of compiler design, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, intermediate code generation, code optimization, and code generation. Students will gain practical experience with tools like lexical analyzers and parsers and learn to apply compiler design principles in system software development.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Understand compiler structure and components.
- Learn lexical and syntax analysis techniques.
- Gain practical skills with compiler tools.

**Topics Covered:**
1. **Compiler Structure** - Overview of phases.
2. **Lexical Analysis** - Tokens, patterns, and lexical analyzers.
3. **Syntax Analysis** - Context-free grammars and parsing techniques.
4. **Symbol Table** - Organization and management.
5. **Syntax Directed Translation** - Attributes and abstract syntax trees (ASTs).
6. **Intermediate Code Generation** - Three-address code.
7. **Code Generation** - Design issues and basic blocks.
8. **Liveness Analysis** - Data flow equations.
9. **Register Allocation** - Techniques and assignment.
10. **Code Optimization** - Peephole and global optimizations.
11. **Garbage Collection** - Techniques overview.
12. **Runtime Memory Models** - Stack allocation.
