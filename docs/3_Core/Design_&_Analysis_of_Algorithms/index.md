# Design & Analysis of Algorithms

Taught by Dr. Siddhaling

This course provides a solid conceptual foundation in Computer Networks, emphasizing design aspects and the latest advancements in the field. It prepares students for more rigorous and specialized studies in related areas. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to analyze, design, troubleshoot, and maintain various network types, as well as initiate network-oriented software development.

**Key Learning Objectives:**

- Understand fundamental concepts and architecture of computer networks.
- Analyze and design network protocols and services.
- Troubleshoot and maintain commonly used network types.
- Begin developing network-oriented software solutions.

**Topics Covered:**

- Introduction to the uses of computer networks and network hardware (the network edge, core, and access networks).
- Theoretical basis for data communication, including Fourier analysis and maximum data rates.
- Internet Service Providers (ISPs), internet backbones, and delay/loss in packet-switched networks.
- Network software, protocol hierarchies, and service models (OSI and TCP/IP).
- Data Link Layer services, error detection and correction techniques, and multiple access protocols (TDM, ALOHA, CSMA).
- Link Layer addressing, including MAC addresses, ARP, DHCP, and Ethernet.
- Wireless networks, including Wi-Fi and 802.11 architecture.
- Network Layer topics such as virtual circuits, routers, and routing algorithms (RIP, OSPF, BGP).
- Transport Layer principles, including TCP, UDP, flow control, and socket programming.
- Application Layer protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS.
- An overview of network security and cryptography.
- Machine Learning applications for networking.
