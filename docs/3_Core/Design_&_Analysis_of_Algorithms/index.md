# Design & Analysis of Algorithms

Taught by Dr. Siddhaling

This course introduces students to algorithm paradigms and analysis techniques, focusing on correctness and complexity (time and space). It covers computational intractability, NP-complete problems, and strategies to tackle them.

**Key Learning Objectives:**

1. **Basic Design Techniques**
   - Divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming

2. **Specialized Design Techniques**
   - Network flow, randomization, analysis, and limitations

3. **Complexity Classes and Hardness of Problems**
   - P, NP, reductions, NP hardness, NP completeness, standard NP-complete problems

4. **Design Techniques for Hard Problems**
   - Backtracking, branch and bound, approximation algorithms

5. **Linear Programming**
   - Linear programming problems and simplex algorithms

6. **Parallel Programming**
   - Design and analysis of parallel algorithms, multithreaded programming, real-time problems
