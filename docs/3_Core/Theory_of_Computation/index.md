# Theory Of Computation

Taught by Dr. Santhosh Kumar

This course introduces the foundational concepts of formal models of computation and computability. Students will explore a hierarchy of machines and languages, focusing on automata theory, formal languages, and complexity classes.

Key learning objectives include:

- Understanding foundational concepts and notation (infinite sets, proofs, alphabets, languages).
- Exploring finite automata and regular expressions (deterministic and non-deterministic automata, closure properties).
- Investigating context-free grammars and push-down automata (parsing techniques and properties).
- Examining Turing machines as models of computation (recursive languages and Turing machine extensions).
- Understanding computability, decidability, and complexity classification (complexity classes P and NP, reductions).

This course equips students with essential theoretical knowledge in computation and problem classification based on computational complexity.
