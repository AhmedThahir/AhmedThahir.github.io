# Operating Systems

Taught by Dr. Angel Arul Jothi

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of operating systems (OS), focusing on their roles, structures, and management techniques. Students will examine the evolution of OS, process management, and synchronization, as well as memory and storage management strategies.

## Key learning objectives include:

- Understanding the purpose and architecture of operating systems (OS operations and computing environments).
- Exploring the evolution of operating systems (batch processing, multiprogramming, time-sharing).
- Investigating special-purpose operating systems (real-time systems and multimedia applications).
- Examining OS structures and services (system calls, debugging, and system boot processes).
- Analyzing process management (process control blocks, states, and inter-process communication).
- Understanding scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, priority scheduling, and round-robin).
- Exploring process synchronization (critical section problems and synchronization resources).
- Examining deadlock conditions and strategies (preemptable resources and deadlock detection).
- Analyzing memory management techniques (fixed and dynamic partitioning).
- Understanding virtual memory management (paging concepts and demand paging).
- Investigating page replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU, and optimal algorithms).
- Exploring secondary storage structures and I/O scheduling (disk management and RAID).
- Understanding file system implementation (allocation methods and free space management).
- Examining multimedia operating systems (design considerations for multimedia applications).

This course provides students with essential theoretical knowledge and practical understanding of operating systems, preparing them for further studies and careers in computer science and software development.
