## Need for history

1. give examples for theory
2. justifications for proposals and ideas
3. To understand the present
   Lot of conflicts in middle east are due to WW1
4. Notice patterns

## WW1

started in Europe

High speed of industrialization

everyone believed that the best way to progress was through industrialization

### Germany

dissatisfied

get surrounded by its enemies quickly

### Reason

1. nationalism
   1. want an empire
2. Franz Ferdinand got assassinated
   The political objective of the assassination was to free Bosnia of Austria-Hungarian rule and established of a common South Slav ("Yugoslav") state. The assassination precipitated the July crisis which lead to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia and the start of the First World War

### Parties

| Allies (west)    | Alliance (germany)                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| US (joined late) | Germany                                |
| france           | Austro-hungary                         |
| russia           | Italy (switched sides from the allies) |
| UK               | Ottoman empire                         |
| China            |                                        |
| Japan            |                                        |

Italy switched sides cuz it felt like it didn't get much from the war, even though it did a lot

Why US joined WW1

mostly financial

1. to get european allies by supporting
2. maritime - Germany blockade of ships
   Germany sank many American merchant ships around the British Isles, using submarines, prompting the American entry into the war.
