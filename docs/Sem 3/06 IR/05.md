## WW1 in Far East

China v Japan were having an ongoing conflict over territory

Both Japan and China were with the Allies against germany and Austria-hungary

### China

basically china wanted to help the Allies in exchange for help with land disputes with japan

### Japan

Japan already had a military alliance with Britain, but that did not obligate it to enter the war. It joined the Allies in order to make territorial gains: because they wanted to acquire the lands in Far East under German control

## WW2

### Reasons

1. Treaty of Versailles was too unfair to Germany
   At the end of WW1, the entire reparation costs and blame was put on Germany, even though they could not afford to do so
2. The people felt very embarassed and angry and hence wanted to change
   Hitler used this angst as fuel for his propaganda
3. Hitler's occupations and torturing of jews and communists

### Parties

| Allies | Axis    |
| ------ | ------- |
| France | Germany |
| UK     | Italy   |
| US     | Japan   |
| Soviet |         |
| China  |         |

US and Soviet were together?! :open_mouth:

### Why did Japan join axis

It wanted to become independent from the western world

## End of WW2

When Germany had already retreated, Japan was still trying to fight.

Japan bombed pearl harbour; US bombed hiroshima and nagasaki using an atomic bomb.

### Why did US actually end up using the atomic bomb

US claimed that it just wanted to get everything over with and this marked the end of the war.

However, many experts say that US just wanted to try out the bomb to research further about it. This claim is supported by the fact that the first people to reach the site after the bombing were actually researchers like Richard Feynmann

### US and Soviet

Another theory about why US used the bomb is to show it's superiority, because the soviets were also developing nuclear weapons at the time. US didn't even tell soviets about the bombing, because they didn't want the soviets to get there first.
