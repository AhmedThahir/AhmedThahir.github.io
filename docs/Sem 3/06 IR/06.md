## Ind

### Naxalite–Maoist Insurgency

insurgency (violent, armed rebellion against authority)

fought for improved land rights and more jobs for neglected agricultural laborer and the poor

### Siachen Glacier

gives India the “tactical advantage of dominating height.” Sitting at much lower altitudes, Pakistani soldiers are completely “shut off from a view of the Siachen Glacier” and are thus at a “severe tactical disadvantage” all along the AGPL. Demilitarizing the glacier would amount to India surrendering its advantage.

### Kargil War

Prior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. However, in 1984, India violated agreements and acquired the entire Siachen glacier. This provoked Pakistan to fight.

relatively non-violent

- nothing happened in europe, us, soviet
- violence happened in other countries through proxy wars
