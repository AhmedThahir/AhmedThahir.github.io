## Constructivism

there is no reality other than what we give to it; it’s ideas that matter

how countries view each other

Power resides where people believe it resides

> Power resides where men believe it resides
> ***Varys - Game of Thrones***

A state’s ==identity== is what threatens us

anarchy isn’t exactly objective reality, but it is the meaning people give it

they don’t think that anarchy is a factor for international relations

value thingy - an example is paradox of value example

better theory to explain **change** in relations

they say that nuclear weapons provide a prestigue, identity and status for countries, as it’s a small club

they say that countries fight for ideology, not just power; US govt went after the communists within US also

### US and UK

US doesn’t think of UK’s military improvement as a threat; so clearly constuctivism is a good theory

### Constructivist’s view of Hiroshima Bombing

because japanese were demonised in the minds of the US people through propaganda

however, US didn’t use atomic bomb in germany during ww2 cuz they were hitler and the germans are europeans; despite hitler using chemical and biological weapons in concentration camps (like the japanese) and other horrible stuff

So constructivists say that this difference in perception is the reason the bombing took place
