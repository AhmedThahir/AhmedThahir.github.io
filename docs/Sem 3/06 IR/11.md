## Structural Realism

says that classical realism is not scientifically sound; states act in response to what is thrown at them; human nature doesnâ€™t matter

Wars happen between states due to systemic anarchy: lack of a central authority (mostly during civil wars)

autocratic countries do their own thing but at the same time, they're more nervous that people will rise up, because

1. not democractic
2. common people die serving a country that isn't even democratic

We can predict how leaders would behave, as they are responsible for their own state's survival. Therefore, they will act very rational, as they wouldn't be in that position if they weren't rational

### Defensive structural realism

Kenneth Waltz

just maximize defense

just as much power you need to protect yourself from other self-seeking states

Eg: Israel's iron dome

### Offensive structural realism

John Mearsheimer (longer name so defense and offense)

maximize power (resources, military defense and offense), as much as you can

Countries can be defensive and/or offensive at different times
Eg: China was defensive realist during 1962 for the land dispute with India, but now it is on the offensive in the South China Sea

## Security Dilemma

Let's just say a country has conflicts with another country.

If the defensive structural realist country beefs up its security, then the offensive structural realist country will feel threatened; therefore, it will also improve its offense in response

According to realists, this is due to focus on relative gains
