Fear in pakistan about nuclear weapons cuz of fear that it will fall under the wrong hands like terrorists

1. Even in india and pak’s case in war, india would always be limited in its strategic decisions. india doesn’t want the wrong people to get hold of the ruins and the nuclear weapons
2. pakistan could just take out the political sphere in order to knock india out, but it can’t because it wants to avoid a new govt that is more against it, and to avoid a headless chicken in charge of the neighboring enemy

## Cooperation

according to realists, cooperation takes place only as long as it benefits yourself; otherwise, the cooperation breaks off

liberals say that once cooperation starts, laws and treaties are to be established to ensure it doesn’t break

### IAEA

international atomic energy agency

the treaty said that nuclear for energy is fine, but the thingies shouldn’t be used for military

### Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)

it happens because it is not seen as a real military weapon

## Indus Water Treaty

even though they are at war, India and Pakistan realized that they shouldn’t fight for water as it is a basic human requirement

Liberals say that they is scope for cooperation even b/w countries at war
