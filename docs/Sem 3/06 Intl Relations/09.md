## China's rise

### Reason china is getting better so quickly

Because they aren't wasting their money unnecessarily on military endeavors, like the US

### Why isn't India rising so quickly

In india, the govt just focuses on implementing policies so as to gain enough popularity to win the next election. hence the policies are always short-sighted, because the ruling party knows that if it makes good long term policies instead of short term, they will lose the next elections and all the benefits of their policies will actually be enjoyed by their successors.

meanwhile, in china, there is only one 'communist' party (which isn't exactly communist), which is always the ruling party; hence, it makes very long term policies

### Military

Not even close to US in terms of physical military

Trying to attack digitally

#### But why does US still spend so much on military

because, that is the only superiority it has over countries. If it loses this advantage, then all the countries that are dependent on it for military purposes might go away

### Allies

Not many allies compared to US

## Quad vs AUKUS

Both are groups of countries against China

| Quad                                                         | AUKUS                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| US                                                           | US                                                           |
| Australia                                                    | Australia                                                    |
| Japan                                                        | UK                                                           |
| India                                                        |                                                              |
| Not much progress, as Japan and China do not want to invite animosity from China; if they join, then they'll get stuck with it | Anti-China nuclear submarine alliance; gained more progress than the Quad |

Australia joining the AUKUS triggered france, because france was dependent on australia to buy submarines from them
