The main reason for conflict is due to lack of trust

According to liberalists, security dilemma is due to absolute gains as well as relative gains

### Points Against Realism

According to liberalists, realism can only explain conflicts but cannot explain peace

Moreover, realism fails to explain why many of the treaties bw US and soviet was signed **during** the cold war

## Neo-liberalism

mix of realism and liberalism

States are rational, and in an international anarchical system, but believe that the world is more peace-loving than realists

## How did EU become possible

1. realization
2. wars are too expensive
3. benefits of scale and trade
4. trust brought about through
   1. laws
   2. treaties
5. common enemy against the soviets
6. begins with the ECSC

## Game theory

(i did not really understood properly)

cooperation occurs as it is better than individual effort

but then one individual just goes against the others and takes everything

## ECSC

European Coal & Steel Community

### Why coal & steel?

because they were the most important resources at the time, and for which conflicts (like hitlerâ€™s occupations) were waged

## Why would nuclear cooperation make sense

1. countries will not longer fear each other
2. Share information to avoid accidental action
3. keep the other one in check
