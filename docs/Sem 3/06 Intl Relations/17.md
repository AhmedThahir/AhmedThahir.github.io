## Marxism

everything occurs only for economic reasons, but disguised by the haves as other stuff (like nationalism, religion, patriotism) etc…

says that wars occur because have-nots are fooled by haves

==game of thrones - the seven - lannisters didn’t care about religion==

it says that the economy is a driving force/defining feature of the world (just like how structural realism considers systemic anarchy) that determines state behavior

projected a better, prosperous and equal world

explains why US came to Saudi for oil

says that radicalization occurs if people aren’t doing so well economically

### Classes

- capital class (haves) (bourgeoisie)
- working class (have-nots) (proletariats)

marxists say that middle class is just fake; they just pretend to care for the working class, but hope to eventually be a part of the capital class

### History

every epoch(era) includes the haves exploiting the have-nots for their own benefit

1. primitive communism (hunter gatherers)
2. slavery
3. feudalism
4. capitalism
5. socialism
6. communism

### Marxism vs Communism

Communism is just marxism, but they also believed there should not be a state, as they believed that the State just represents the haves.

- social classes disappear
- everyone owns the means of production
- state belongs to the people and does not reflect the interests of the rich/haves

communists believed in revolution/wars, as the haves wouldn’t just let the have-nots

therefore, this threat was the reason why the US made sure that it did not spread

communism failed because we all care about personal glory and invidual gain; we don’t really care about if others get money or not
eg: universal basic income is highly argued against

### Explanation for Conflicts

marxists say that conflicts are due to the class divide bw the haves and have nots

in GBR, there was no revolution
because the wealth that came from colonisation by GBR helped get money and better standard of living of the working class

marxists say that due to colonisation, the class conflict becomes global

- Colonizers become the haves
- colonized become the have-nots

### Explanation for World Wars

despite the motive being ‘fighting for the country’, the soldiers are just fighting for the sake of the haves

marxists say that soldiers join the armies just for survival - to make a living

### Why is marxism better?

While other theories explain at a macroscopic level, marxism explains in microscopic level (soldiers)

### Why isn’t it liked?

because he says that religion and others stuff matter a lot to the people, but they are just an illusion; this triggered the whole world

also, Marx has ignored the fact that there a lot of people who are genuinely religious, nationalist, etc… which seems pretty ignorant on his part

## Examples of war from the Marxist Perspective

western countries trying to exploit the have-nots from the other countries

capitalists disallow trade unions in order to maximize profits

### US-Guatemala

United Fruit Banana

(view slides)

the decision to overthrow the Guatemala govt was purely to maintain the profits of the company, rather than just pure anti-communism

Guatemala has never recovered from that

### US-Iran

Iran cut off oil supply for UK, and the US overthrew that leader. The new leader was actually a previous Shah who was very corrupt.

### 2nd Gulf War

reasons

1. Iraq wasn’t supposed to have weapons of mass destruction
2. oil

random definition: despot means autocrat

Halliburton was an oil services and eng company
it went from 22nd -> 7th largest military contractor in just a few years

### Another aspect of Marxism

hegemony - kinda like domination

> In Marxist philosophy, cultural hegemony is the dominance of a culturally diverse society by the ruling class who manipulate the culture of that society—the beliefs and explanations, perceptions, values, and mores—so that the worldview of the ruling class becomes the accepted cultural norm
