| :-------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
|      Topic      | what is the problem                                          | how the world should be  |
|     Nature      | objective                                                    | subjective               |
| Characteristics | analytic and descriptive                                     | prescripitive            |
|      Extra      | Why the problem came up<br />no emotions/explanations if good or bad | what actions to be taken |

## Budget deficit

if expenditure of govt is greater than revenue

this happens a lot in developing countries

## Opportunity cost

OC $= \frac{\text{what you sacrifice}}{\text{what you get}}$

it is a fraction that shows

- what you sacrificed to pick an option A instead of B
- what am I losing by skipping on option B

you can incorporate this into your daily life instead of regular pros/cons list, by adding a cost/benefit associated with every factor for a decision
