# Finite Element Analysis

Finite element analysis (FEA) is a computerized method for predicting how a product reacts to real-world forces, vibration, heat, fluid flow, and other physical effects.

FEA helps identify if a product will break, wear out, or work the way it was designed.

## Steps

- Create model
- Create parts
- Create sets for boundary conditions and loads
- Merge parts to assembly
- Materials
  - Create materials and sections
  - Assign materials to sections

- Create steps
- Specify output requests
- Specify boundary conditions
- Specify loads
- Generate Mesh
- Create jobs
- Run jobs

Job = Simulation
