# Cracks

- Advanced topic: Only covered after Bachelor’s and Master’s level courses
- Rare topic: Most FEA does not focus on cracks, since cracks are due to failure of the initial manufacturing stage and hence crack FEA is an after-thought

## Crack Properties

|                       |                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Characteristic length |                                                              |
| Fracture energy       | Proportional to mesh size<br />How much energy required to break one finite element |
| Displacement          |                                                              |
