## Biomass

Renewable/organic material produced by animals and plants.

## Biological Productivity

the rate at which biomass is produced

unit $\frac{ \rm{kg} }{ m^2 \text{day} }$

### Gross Primary

Rate at which an ecosystem’s producers convert solar energy to chemical energy and biomass

### Net Primary

Rate at which an ecosystem’s producers convert solar energy to chemical energy minus the rate at which producers use energy for aerobic respiration

\text{NPP = GPP - R}

NPP is higher in areas with higher growth rates and high biomass density

- In terrestrial ecoystems, wetter areas have greater NPP
- In aquatic ecosystems, less saltier areas have greater NPP
