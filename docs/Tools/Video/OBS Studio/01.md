## Live [Pseudo] Motion Blur

I know this is a very old question, i found a new method where you can use more than 2 or 3 Game Capture screens by putting a second Game Capture duplicated by Duplicate (Reference) inside a Group Folder and editing the group folder's filters with Color Correction then adding 30 - 70 ms of Render delay (render delay may depend on how high your fps is. mine is currently on 40 ms on 50 PAL) then there you go.

This method is better since using too many Window Captures (for me) lags my OBS.
