## Rules

You can use Arduino to make a commercial product following some simple rules.

- if you have made your circuit as a derivative of the Arduino board you must release the design files with a CC-BY-SA license like the original cad files
- If you build your circuit as a shield that plugs on top of an Arduino board all the circuit is yours and you don't have to release anything
- The programs written on Arduino are yours. if you have modified the core files or one of the libraries you must make your modifications available to everybody
- You can call your product in any way you like as long as you don't call it Arduino
- Credits to Arduino not necessary
  - If in the documentation for your product you want to write "Powered By Arduino" that would be appreciated
- There is no revenue sharing for any derivative work (unless it uses the Arduino name see [Arduino - Home](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Policy) )
- If you patent something you have to do that in every place in the world you want to protect your idea. the more countries the more payments
  - Patents reveal your idea to the whole world.. some people don't patent so they don't have to provide any detail about their invention
