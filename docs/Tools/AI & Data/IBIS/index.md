# IBIS

Ibis is the portable Python dataframe library:

- Fast local dataframes (via DuckDB by default)
- Lazy dataframe expressions
- Interactive mode for iterative data exploration
- [Compose Python dataframe and SQL code](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis#python--sql-better-together)
- Use the same dataframe API for [20+ backends](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis#backends)
- Iterate locally and deploy remotely by [changing a single line of code](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis#portability)
