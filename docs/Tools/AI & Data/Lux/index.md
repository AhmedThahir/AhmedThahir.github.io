# Lux

Python library that facilitate fast and easy data exploration by automating the visualization and data analysis process. By simply printing out a dataframe in a Jupyter notebook, Lux recommends a set of visualizations highlighting interesting trends and patterns in the dataset. Visualizations are displayed via [an interactive widget](https://github.com/lux-org/lux-widget) that enables users to quickly browse through large collections of visualizations and make sense of their data.
