# üëã Welcome!

Hi, I'm Thahir - I work with Data & Machine Learning. Currently working as an Associate Analyst at Delivery Hero talabat.

Over the last ~1.5 years, I've had the chance to contribute across airlines, FMCG, and e-commerce, building projects that help companies spot patterns, deal with uncertainty, make better decisions, and launch consumer-facing products. I love finding the balance between hitting algorithmic metrics and bigger business goals, and I've been lucky enough to do that at both global and regional levels.

Along the way, I've built and deployed data products that draw from a mix of skills: data analytics, machine learning, stakeholder management, and financial modeling & analysis. The tools I'm most comfortable with are Python and SQL for core work, with Scikit-learn and PyTorch on the ML side, plus Power BI and Sisense for dashboards and insights. For collaboration and quick delivery, I make heavy use of Excel/PowerPoint/Word and the Google Suite.

## About this repo

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance Optimizations

- Network-first PWA (offline-use possible)
- Minifying & combining CSS/JS
- Lazy loading images
- Prefetching links
- Using katex instead of mathjax
- `content-visibility: auto`

### Why PWA?

PWA are applications that have been designed to be capable, reliable, and installable with a single codebase.

Using a PWA in this case allows the contributors of the website and I to ensure legible and understandable content, without worrying about the app development.
