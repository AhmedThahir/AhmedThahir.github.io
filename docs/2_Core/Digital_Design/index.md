This course provides a solid foundation in digital circuit design, introducing essential concepts like number systems, error detection and correction codes, and Boolean algebra. It covers the design and functionality of basic digital components, such as adders, comparators, decoders, multiplexers, and memory elements like RAM and ROM. Students will also explore advanced circuit elements, including latches, flip-flops, counters, and shift registers, with an emphasis on both synchronous and asynchronous sequential circuits. 

The course includes hands-on experience with Verilog for simulating digital designs, allowing students to implement and test circuits, including sequence detectors and counters. Additionally, it introduces state machine models (Moore and Mealy), and circuit design techniques for various applications, including Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog converters. Through both theoretical knowledge and practical Verilog programming, students gain skills to design and analyze digital circuits effectively.

This course is a pre-requisite to understanding Microprocessors and Interfacing in the next semester.
