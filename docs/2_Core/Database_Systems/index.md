The scope of the course is to introduce the basic concepts and implementation issues of a Database System. This course is intended to give students a solid background in databases, with a focus on relational database management systems. 

Topics include data modeling, database design theory, data definition and manipulation languages, storage and indexing techniques, query processing and optimization, concurrency control and crash recovery. In addition to these traditional topics, this course covers a sample of advanced database topics such as distributed databases and spatial-temporal databases. The emphasis is to learn the concepts through rigorous mathematical foundation and implementation details.

Unfortunately, query optimization (a very important concept) was skipped for my batch due to time contraints.
