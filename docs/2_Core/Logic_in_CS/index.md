This course introduces the foundational concepts of logic essential to computer science, emphasizing both theoretical and practical aspects. It begins with propositional logic, covering syntax, semantics, and concepts like satisfiability and validity, and progresses to predicate logic, where students learn about completeness, compactness, undecidability, and incompleteness. These topics establish a basis for understanding the logical structure of computation and problem-solving in computer science.

The course further explores advanced topics such as model checking for verification, including linear-time temporal logic (LTL) and computational tree logic (CTL), which are crucial for verifying program behavior. Hoare logic is introduced for program verification, allowing students to construct correctness proofs. Modal logic and logic programming are also covered, broadening studentsâ€™ understanding of logic as applied in various computer science applications.
