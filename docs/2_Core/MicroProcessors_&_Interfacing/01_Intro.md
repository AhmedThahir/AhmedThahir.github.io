## What happens when we switch on computer

1. BIOS(Basic Input Output System) loaded **from** the ROM(Read-Only Memory)
2. BIOS loads OS **into** the RAM
   RAM should atleast be the size of the OS
3. OS loads programs from disk to RAM
   Program: set of instructions executed by $\mu p$

## What is an instruction?

Tells the MP what actions to perform

- operations
    - logic
    - arithmetic
- read data from input device
- write to memory
- reset
- stop

Assembly program gives these instructions. Each microprocessor understands these instructions in different ways.

High-level program use statements which get compiled/interpreted into machine language. Allows programmer focus on the logic, rather than worrying about how it will understood by the MP.

## Microprocessor

has both sequential and combinational circuits

- Control unit has sequential circuits
- ALU has combinational circuits

Size of the processor = size of ALU

## Instruction-Handling

Instructions is a set of command, used by the mp to perform to certain taks

1. **Fetch Instruction**
   Instruction taken from the memory and stored in instruction register
2. **Decode Instruction**
3. **Fetch Operand(s)**
3. **Execute Cycle**
   actions are performed
5. **Store result**

- BIU - Bus Interface Unit
- ALU - Arithmetic Logic Unit
- Execution Unit

## x86 Family

- CISC
- Instructions are broken into $\micro$ operations

8086 has 1MB capacity

|       | Bits | Address Lines |
| ----- | ---- | ------------- |
| 8086  | 16   |               |
| 80286 | 16   |               |
| 80386 |      |               |
| 80486 |      |               |

## 8086 (Tut)

|                              |          |                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Lines                        | 20       | $A_0 \to A_{19}$ |
| Data bus                     | 16       | $A_0 \to A_{15}$ |
| memory locations             | $2^{20}$ |                  |
| Size of each memory location | 1 byte   | 8 bits           |
| total memory                 | 2 MB     |                  |

Byte-organised

We represent the address of each location in 5bit hex $00000H \to FFFFFH$

If we need to store 16bits of data

- we need 2 bytes
- so we will require 2 contigious memory locations

### Memory Addressing

Each range of addresses is allocated for different **segments **of registers

- Code segment
- Data segment
- Stack segment
- Extra segment
- Instruction pointer

If CS = 10000 and offet = 0002, then DS = 10002

## Internal Cache

a small and fast SRAM memory attached to the processor, for pre-fetching data

## Registers

## IDK

The reason we're left-shifting by 1 digit is because

- **Address** is to be 20 bits (5hex digits)
- **Pointer** we want to hold 16bits (4 hex digits)
  because the blocks in x86 architecture
