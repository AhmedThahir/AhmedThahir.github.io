This course provides an essential introduction to processor instruction set architecture (ISA), assembly programming, and both computer and embedded architecture, with a focus on the Intel 80x86 platform. It covers the programmer's model for processors from the 8086 to the 80486, exploring topics such as instruction sets, modular assembly programming techniques, and timing diagrams.

Students will learn about interrupts—both hardware and software—along with interrupt handling techniques and controllers. The curriculum also addresses memory types and interfacing, programmable peripheral devices, I/O interfacing, and DMA controllers, equipping students with the skills necessary for designing processor-based systems.
