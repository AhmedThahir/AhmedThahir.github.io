# Discrete Structures for Computer Science

This course provides a strong foundation in logical and mathematical concepts necessary for understanding computational systems and analyzing complex problems in computer science. Emphasizing formal abstract concepts, the course covers essential mathematical skills that are foundational for advanced topics like algorithm design. Students will study recursion, learning to write recursive definitions for sequences and collections, which is fundamental in various computational contexts.

Additionally, the course delves into graph theory, exploring concepts such as directed and planar graphs and their applications in circuit design and map coloring. It also introduces the basics of group theory, providing insights into its relevance in computer science. These topics collectively equip students with the mathematical reasoning needed for more specialized computer science courses and problem-solving in real-world computational challenges.
