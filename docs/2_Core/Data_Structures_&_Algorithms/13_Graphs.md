[Graphs in Discrete Structures](../Discrete_Structures/04_Graphs.md) 

Graphs without parallel edges and self loops are called as simple graphs.

## Representations

### Adjacency Matrix (Array)

$O(n^2)$

|        | **9** | **7** | **40** | **60** |
| :----: | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----: |
| **9**  |   1   |   0   |   1    |   0    |
| **7**  |   1   |   1   |   1    |   1    |
| **40** |   0   |   0   |   1    |   1    |
| **6**  |   0   |   1   |   0    |   1    |

### Adjacency List (Linked List)

More efficient, as $O(n)$

## Applications

1. Networks
     - Computer Networks
     - Transportation
2. Computer Vision
   Pixels

## Connected Graph/Components

## Traversals

| BFS           | DFS         |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Breadth First | Depth First |
| Queue         | Stack       |

### Trick to remember

If the person is a **Queue-t**, they‚Äôll take your **breadth** away.

If it is a **stack**, it has a **depth** associated with it.

## Single Source Shortest Path

Path from a single start point to every other point in the graph

### Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm

each step has connected components

Time complexity: $O(v^2)$

If you use minimum priority queue, it‚Äôll be $O(v+e \log v)$

#### Disavantages

It requires

1. Simple graph
2. Connected graph
3. Positive Weights only

## Minimum Spanning Tree

A tree that has all the vertices of the source graph, but only the minimum required edges to span the entire graph.

### Prim‚Äôs Algorithm

### Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm

independent of starting address

### Steps

1. List out edges in the ascending order of weights
2. Start with the minimum starting algorithm
3. Connect in that order, ensuring
   1. no cycles
   2. no connected components

### Working

| Edge         | Weight | Action |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ |
| $(v_1, v_2)$ | 1      | Accept |
| $(v_2, v_3)$ | 3      | Reject |
| $(v_3, v_4)$ | 10     | Accept |

```pseudocode
find(u)

union(u, v)
```

### Prim vs Kruskal

|                           |           Prim            |    Kruskal    |
| ------------------------- | :-----------------------: | :-----------: |
| Starting Edge             |             ‚úÖ             |       ‚ùå       |
| Chooses ___ at every edge | nearest/cheapest neighbor | cheapest edge |
| Better for ___ graph      |          Denser           |    Sparse     |
| Insertion of vertices     |             üëç             |       üëé       |
|                           |                           |               |
