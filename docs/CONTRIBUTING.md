## Want to introduce new course? 🤩

1. Navigate to docs > *relevant folder the course belongs to*
2. Click on *Add file*
3. On the text field for the file name, first write the course name you want to introduce
4. Then type `/`. This creates a new folder
5. You can add more folders similarly
6. Finally, give the new file a name (for example, `Topic.md` (Do not forget the file extension))
7. Finally, click *Commit changes*.

## 💡 Additional Tips

- Use tables over lists whenever possible. This helps in grouping related concepts.

- Use mermaid flowcharts to simplify processes, flows, trees.

- Use LaTeX for mathematical/scientifical expressions. (Blurry images are not cool 😔👎)
