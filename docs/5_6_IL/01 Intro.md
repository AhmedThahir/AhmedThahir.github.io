## International Law

Study of interactions between states over time. It is also a history of ideas and accounts of how states behave and international laws are made.

International law has evolved over the years using good customs.

Conventions of Geneva conventions were brought into international law.

> Any law ratified by 50 countries, is an international law.

### Processes

### Example

Harming ambassadors, envoys, messengers is internationally-banned, as the communication will be cut if off.

70-80 signed Treaty of Nuclear Weapons; India didn’t; countries have a tendancy to say no to nuclear weapons when they don’t have; but when they have them, their view will change (like kids).

## Signing vs Ratification

| Signing                                      | Ratification                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| normal signing by a country’s representative | agreed upon by everyone in the country (opposition parties, etc) |
|                                              |                                                              |
|                                              |                                                              |
