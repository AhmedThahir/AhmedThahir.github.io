# Counting

## Fundamental counting principle

No of ways $= n_1 \times n_2 \times \dots$

How many different $x$ digit numbers can be created using $n$ digits only: $y^x$

## Factorial

$n$ **unique** objects can be arranged in $n!$ ways

## Restrictions

No of ways to follow rule = no of ways to ignore rule - no of ways to break rule

## Duplicates

When there are duplicate objects
$$
\begin{aligned}
&= \dfrac{n!}{\prod_i^k n_i!}
\end{aligned}
$$
where 

- $k=$ no of unique groups
- $n_i =$ no of objects in group $k$
- $\sum_i^k n_i = n$

## Permutation



## Combination

- Order doesnâ€™t matter
- Outcomes of one stage are same as outcomes of other stages
