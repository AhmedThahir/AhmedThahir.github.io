# Integers

- Divisibility: No remainder
  - Divisor = Factor
  - Multiple
  - Rules
    - 2: Number is even
    - 3: sum of digits is divisible by 3
    - 4: 2 trailing digits divisible by 4
    - 5: last digit is 0 or 5
    - 6: Number divisible by 2 and 3
    - 7:
    - 8:
    - 9: Sum of digits divisible by 9
    - 10: Last digit is 0
- Prime numbers
  - +ve integer with only 2 divisors: 1 and itself 
  - 1 is neither prime nor composite
  - 2 is only even prime number
- Prime factorization
  - Any integer > 1 is either prime or can be expressed be expressed as product of prime numbers
  - If $n= p^a q^b r^c \cdots$ where $p, q, r, \dots$ are prime factors of $n$, then total number of positive divisors of $n$ is $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) \cdots$
- Squares of integers
  - called perfect squares
  - Prime factorization will always have even no of each prime
  - Will always have odd numbers of +ve divisors
- GCD/HCF
  - Names
    - Greatest Common Divisor
    - Greatest Common Factor
    - Highest Common Factor
  - Greatest +ve common divisor shared by 2/more numbers
- LCM
  - Least common multiple
  - Smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers
- $\text{HCF}(x, y) \times \text{LCM}(x, y) = x \times y$
- Operations with odd/even integers
  - Product of odd numbers is always odd
    - Add/sub
      - Odd +- odd = even
      - Odd +- even = odd
      - Even +- even = even
    - Mul
      - Odd x odd = odd
      - Odd x even = even
      - even x even = even
    - Div
      - Even/Even can be anything
      - Odd/even = non-integer
      - Even/odd = non-integer or even integer
      - Odd/odd: non-integer or odd integer
- Consecutive integers
  - Every $n$th number is divisible by $n$
  - $n$ consecutive integers $\implies$ 1 number must be divisible by $n$
- Remainders
  - Remainder $\in$ [0, Divisor)
  - Dividend = divisor x quotient  +  remainder
  - If $n/D = Q \text{ with } R$, then possible values of $n$ are $R + aD$, where $a \ge 0$
