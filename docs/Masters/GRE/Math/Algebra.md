# Algebra

- Like terms: Terms with identical variables that can be added/subtracted
- Identities
- Factoring
- Quadratic formula
  - $x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a}, D=b^2 - 4ac$
  - $D<0 \implies$ no solution
- Simultaneous equations
  - No soln: $0x+0y=k, k \ne 0$
  - Unique soln
  - Infinitely-many solns: $0x+0y=0$
- Extraneous roots
  - occur for
    - even exponents
    - absolute value
- Functions
- Defined in the question
  - Custom operators
  - Formula (area, volume, temp conversion)
- Inequalities
  - Only adding inequalities always holds true
    - Hence, avoid sub, mul, div
  - Quadratic
    - Set expo to zero
    - Find solutions
    - Record on number line
    - Test number on each region
    - Solve inequality
