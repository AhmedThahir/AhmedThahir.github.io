# Geometry

- Line
  - Bisector: divide into 2
  - Perpendicular bisector
  - Transversal: passes through 2 || lines
    - All angles formed are equal due to VOA and AIA
- Angle
  - GRE only focuses on degrees
    - No need to learn radians
  - Vertically-opposite angles are equal
  - Alternate interior angles are equal

## Triangles

- Vertices
- Angles add upto 180
- Edges
  - Angles-Edges
    - Shortest edger oppo to smallest angle
    - Longest edge oppo to largest angle
  - $\vert a-b \vert < c < (a+b)$

Area = $\dfrac{1}{2} bh$

### Isosceles

- 2 equal angles
- 2 equal edges

### Equlaterial

- 3 equal angles: 60,60,60
- 3 equal edges

Area = $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2$

Altitudes of isosceles and equilateral triangles always bisect the base

### Right-Triangle

- Pythagorean theorem: $a^2+b^2 = c^2$
  - Pythagorean triplet: Set of 3 integers that can be the sides of a right triangle
    - Common
      - 3-4-5
      - 5-12-13
      - 8-15-17
      - 7-24-25
    - Multiple of triples is also a triple
    - 2 corresponding sides are required for a triple

- 45-45-90: $x, x, x \sqrt{2}$
  - Hiding in squares
- 30-60-90: $x, x\sqrt{3}, 2x$
  - Hiding in equilateral triangle

## Similar Triangles

All three angles are equal

Ratio of any pair of corresponding sides is the same

## Quadrilaterals

4 edges

Angles add upto 360 deg

- Parallelogram
  - Opposite sides are parallel
  - Opposite sides are equal
  - Opposite angles are equal
- Rhombus
  - Parallelogram with equal edges
  - Diagonals are perpendicular bisectors
  - $\dfrac{1}{2} d_1 d_2$
- Rectangle
  - Parallelogram with all angles 90
  - Diagonals are equal length
- Square
  - Rectangle with equal edges
  - Diagonals are perpendicular bisectors
  - Diagonals are equal length
- Trapezoid/Trapezium
  - 1 pair of parallel edges
  - $\dfrac{1}{2}h(a+b)$

## Polygons

Sum of angles of polygon with $n$ edges = $180(n-2)$

Convex polygon: all interior angles < 180

- Pentagon: angles add up to 540
- Hexagon: angles add up to 720

Regular polygon: equal sides and equal angles

## Circles

- center
- radius
- Chord: line segment passing connecting 2 points of circumference
- diameter: chord passing through center
- Arc
  - Minor arc
  - Major arc
- Sector
- Circumference: $2 \pi r$
- Area: $\pi r^2$

Properties

- Inscribed angles on the same side of a chord/arc held are equal
- Inscribed angles holding  chord/arc of equal lengths are equal
- Inscribed angles holding diameter is 90deg
- Central angle is 2 x inscribed angle holding the same chord/arc
- Radius $\perp$ tangent at the point of intersection

## Volume

- Cube: $a^3$
- Cuboid: $lbh$
- Cylinder: $\pi r^2 h$

## Surface Area

- Cube: $6 a^2$
- Cuboid: $2(lb + bh + lh)$
- Cylinder: $2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r h$

## Units of Measurement

- Metric: km, kg, L
- English/Imperial: miles, pounds, gallons

All conversions will be given in GRE

Only units of time are expected to be known

## Strategies

- Redraw figures
- Add all given information
- Add all information that can be deduced
- Add/extend lines
- Assign vars and use algebra
- 2/more triangles & lengths required
  - Look for similar triangles
- Right triangle
  - Look out for triples
  - Use pythagorean theorem
- Circles
  - Look out for circle properties
  - Look out for isosceles triangles
