# Quantitative Comparison

## Options

- A > B
- B > A
- A = B
- Cannot be determined

## Notes

1. Do not perform more calculations than necessary
2. Do not select D if comparison does not contain unknown values
3. ==**Geometry figures are not necessarily drawn to scale, unless stated otherwise**==
4. Pay attention to shared information

## Strategies

1. Approximation
2. Matching operations: perform same operations on both quantities
   1. Add both sides
   2. Subtract both sides
   3. Multiply both sides **by +ve constant**
   4. Divide both sides **by +ve constant**
      1. Variable can be positive/negative
3. Plugging in numbers
4. Looking for equality
5. Number sense
