# Welcome!

Hi there, I'm Ahmed Thahir. These are the lecture notes I've taken over the years.

You can install the app right now (you should get a `Add to Home Screen` popup). Hope it helps you!

Make sure to ⭐ this project on GitHub. Feel free to share this to everyone you know.

## Tips

- Use the navbar ⬅️ to go through the website
- If you've got any changes/corrections:
    - Create a GitHub pull request, if you can correct it
    - Create an GitHub issue, if you just want to report it
