What you’re currently using is a PWA, which dramatically simplifies this entire notes initiative, but is not supported on a few browsers. They are web applications that have been designed to be capable, reliable, and installable with a single codebase.

Using a PWA in this case allows the contributors of the website and I to ensure legible and understandable content, without worrying about the app development.
